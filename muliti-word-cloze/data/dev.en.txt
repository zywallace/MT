Not unlike North Korea &apos;s and Iran &apos;s defiant nuclear policies , Bashar &apos;s membership in the region &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; is a call for dialogue with America , not an invitation to an invasion , and for a settlement with Israel , not a drive to wage war on it .
In Egypt , Mubarak turned his back on the lofty rhetoric of Gamal Abdel @-@ Nasser &apos;s revolution and its grand strategic designs .
Stability is at the heart of his thinking .
Hence , he could not accept America &apos;s awkward pro @-@ democracy agenda .
But he was more than willing to occupy center stage in Arab diplomacy &apos;s support of the Annapolis peace conference .
After all , the passion that the Palestinians &quot; plight evokes among ordinary Egyptians is a dangerous source of instability .
Mubarak &apos;s succession is being conducted in an especially sophisticated manner .
His son &apos;s ascension , unlike that of Bashar on the eve of his father &apos;s death , is anything but settled .
But , by being allowed to acquire popular legitimacy and a high degree of acceptance within the political establishment as the driving force behind the ruling party &apos;s preparations for the post @-@ Mubarak era , Gamal is being positioned strategically to compete effectively for the presidency .
He is widely credited for setting the country &apos;s agenda , and for being the motor behind the liberal economic reforms that since 2004 have meant a qualitative leap in the Egyptian economy .
It may be , as President Mubarak &apos;s critics argue , that the faltering progress of democratization reflects the attempt to block all potential challengers to Gamal .
But , with the decline of secular nationalism and Islamism &apos;s rise , the hidden electoral power of the Muslim Brotherhood poses a mortal threat to the regime and its strategic alliance with the West .
As a result , the regime refuses to take any chances .
Nor was Muammar Khaddafi &apos;s decision to stop being an international pariah entirely unrelated to his concern to bequeath to his son a state that lives in peace with the world .
His abysmal human rights record remains , but the flamboyant &quot; Guide of the Revolution &quot; ceased flirting with weapons of mass destruction and global terrorism in exchange for the end of sanctions and international rehabilitation .
A sick man whose rule at home is being challenged by Islamist opponents , he decided that international ostracism and domestic troubles is too explosive a combination for his son , a spoiled playboy , to handle .
Algeria is an especially difficult case .
The last of the revolutionary generation , President Abdulaziz Buteflika must still conceive a succession that ends his country &apos;s civil war .
Fully @-@ fledged democracy might lead to victory for Islamists , as it did in 1991 .
A transition to democracy in the old revolutionary Arab regimes will not correspond to a Western model , nor can it be imposed by American F @-@ 16 &quot; s .
But , as countries like Egypt , Syria , and Lybia might be indicating , hereditary succession is not an inherently reactionary move .
Rather , it means opting for a controlled transition to a post @-@ revolutionary phase in which economic modernization and international integration might usher in greater political change in the future .
Arab Myths and Realities
WASHINGTON , DC - With Hosni Mubarak &apos;s ouster in Egypt - widely considered to have one of the region &apos;s most stable regimes until only recently - and Colonel Muammar Qaddafi clinging to power in Libya , there is no clear end in sight to the turmoil sweeping across the Arab world .
Protests have already toppled governments in Tunisia and Egypt , leaving other Arab countries faced with widespread discontent .
The unrest caught most people by surprise - both inside and outside the region - and has fundamentally upended at least five conventional beliefs about the Arab world .
Arabs don &apos;t go into the street .
Before the protests began in Egypt and Tunisia , many people argued that there was no real urgency to political reform , and that those who were calling for change did not understand the public mood - things weren &apos;t as bad as the dissidents made them out to be .
This line of thinking led governments to believe that Arabs would not demonstrate in large numbers and demand change .
In each country , rapid reform was seen as detrimental to national interests .
This argument clearly is no longer tenable .
No one predicted what happened in Egypt and Tunisia , which means that no Arab country is immune .
Governments don &apos;t have the luxury of waiting forever , and they can no longer use the myth of popular quiescence to avoid initiating the necessary reforms that will address the public &apos;s underlying grievances .
Economic liberalization should precede political reform .
Arab governments - and many Westerners - claimed that privatization and other economic reforms should be given priority over political change .
But , while it is easy to argue that citizens want bread before freedom , economic liberalization came without a system of checks and balances , and thus largely resulted in neither bread nor freedom .
Instead , the benefits of privatization and other initiatives went largely to political and business elites .
As a result , Arabs have come to view liberalization and globalization negatively .
It is clear by now that economic reform must be coupled with political reform , so that institutional mechanisms of accountability are developed to monitor any excesses and ensure that benefits are made available to all .
Governments have been quick to believe that the protests are fundamentally about high prices and unemployment , but the issue that unites Arab discontent is inadequate governance .
Closed systems are necessary to prevent Islamists from taking power .
The West is often afraid that democracy will give Islamists the opening they need to gain control - a fear that Arab regimes exploit to justify maintaining closed political systems .
But Islamists did not play a big role in Egypt or Tunisia , and they are not expected to lead any of the new governments that are formed - though they are an important part of Arab societies and should play a role in their emerging regimes .
So it is untrue that the only viable alternative to unrelenting absolutist rule must be Islamist .
The protests are clearly the result of ordinary citizens becoming fed up with corruption , the lack of any semblance of rule of law , and arbitrary treatment .
There is an opportunity here to start developing pluralistic systems where not only Islamists , but also other parties and discourses can play a role .
Elections equal democracy .
No one is fooled by this claim anymore .
In order to maintain their dominance , Arab governments have relied on flawed laws and elections that don &apos;t produce strong parliaments or lead to real change .
Indeed , in countries like Egypt and Tunisia , government and parliament alike were unpopular .
Throughout the region , elections have been used to create a façade of democracy aimed at impressing citizens and the outside world while insulating the regimes from pressure for genuine reform .
The Arab public , however , will no longer accept the status quo .
People will not be satisfied with economic handouts or cosmetic changes in governance ; they are demanding real change that puts their country on a clear path toward democracy .
The international community has no role to play .
While the reform process should certainly be homegrown , the United States and the rest of the international community can encourage democratic development without imposing it from afar .
President Barack Obama rejected many of the policies of the George W. Bush administration that were seen as trying to force democracy on Arab countries .
But the subsequent silence on democratization aggravated - though it certainly did not cause - the unraveling of the Arab reform process in the last few years .
The US and the West can discuss with Arab countries how political reform should be carried out in a way that would contribute to greater openness and opportunities for power @-@ sharing .
The West should not sacrifice these objectives for others ; if allies ultimately lose power in popular revolts , such a tradeoff would not have furthered the West &apos;s interests , to say the least .
The unfolding events grabbing headlines around the world have shattered key myths about the Arab world .
These countries &quot; people need to start gradual , sustained , and serious political reform now .
At the dawn of a new Arab era , it is up to them to build new , open political systems that can head off the looming threat of escalating crises .
Arab Spring , Western Fall
TEL AVIV - The old vocation of what Rudyard Kipling called the &quot; White Man &apos;s Burden &quot; - the driving idea behind the West &apos;s quest for global hegemony from the days of imperial expansion in the nineteenth century to the current , pathetically inconclusive , Libyan intervention - has clearly run out of steam .
Politically and economically exhausted , and attentive to electorates clamoring for a shift of priorities to urgent domestic concerns , Europe and America are no longer very capable of imposing their values and interests through costly military interventions in faraway lands .
US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was stating the obvious when he recently lambasted NATO &apos;s European members for their lukewarm response to the alliance &apos;s missions , and for their poor military capabilities .
( Ten weeks into the fighting in Libya , the Europeans were already running out of munitions . )
He warned that if Europe &apos;s attitude to NATO did not change , the Alliance would degenerate into &quot; collective military irrelevance . &quot;
Europe &apos;s reluctance to participate in military endeavors should not come as a revelation .
The Old Continent has been immersed since World War II in a &quot; post @-@ historical &quot; discourse that rules out the use of force as a way to resolve conflicts , let alone to bring about regime change .
And now it is engaged in a fateful struggle to secure the very existence and viability of the European Union . As a result , Europe is retreating into a narrow regional outlook - and assuming that America will carry the burden of major global issues .
But America itself is reconsidering its priorities .
These are trying economic times for the US , largely owing to imperial overstretch financed by Chinese credit .
Admiral Mike Mullen , the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , recently defined America &apos;s colossal fiscal deficits as the biggest threat to its national security .
Indeed , at a time of painful budget cuts - the US is facing a $ 52 trillion shortfall on public pensions and health care in the coming decades - the US can no longer be expected to maintain its current level of global military engagement .
But the fiscal crisis is not the whole story .
The dire lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will shape future debate about America &apos;s international role in the twenty @-@ first century .
At an address in February to cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point , Gates said that &quot; any future defense secretary who advises the president to send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined . &quot;
Gates &apos;s recent statements are by no means those of a lonely isolationist in an otherwise interventionist America .
He expressed a widely perceived imperative for strategic reassessment .
In 1947 , in a landmark article , &quot; The Sources of Soviet Conduct , &quot; which he signed as &quot; X , &quot; George Kennan defined America &apos;s foreign @-@ policy strategy for the Cold War as one of containment and deterrence .
It is difficult to imagine a more marked departure from Kennan &apos;s concepts than a report recently released by the Pentagon - A National Strategic Narrative - authored by two active @-@ duty military officers who signed as &quot; Y. &quot;
The report can be dismissed as just the musings of two senior members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff writing in their &quot; personal capacity . &quot;
But its real power stems from the degree to which it reflects America &apos;s mood in an era of declining global influence and diminishing expectations regarding the relevance of military power to sustaining US global hegemony .
Just as Kennan &apos;s &quot; X &quot; article was fully reflective of the mood in America at the time , so the Narrative expresses the current American Zeitgeist .
Thus , the idea that &quot; Y &quot; might turn out to be a latter @-@ day &quot; X &quot; - defining the nature of America &apos;s international role in the twenty @-@ first century - may not be far @-@ fetched .
Conspicuously , there is much in the Narrative that coincides with Europe &apos;s emphasis on soft power .
The authors call for a shift from outdated Cold War strategies of &quot; power and control &quot; to one of civic engagement and sustainable prosperity .
Security , they maintain , means more than defense .
It means engagement whereby America should not seek &quot; to bully , intimidate , cajole , or persuade others to accept our unique values or to share our national objectives . &quot;
America , &quot; Y &quot; argues , must first put its own house in order if it is to recover credible global influence as a beacon of prosperity and justice .
This would require improving America &apos;s diplomatic capabilities , as well as regaining international competitiveness through greater investment in education and infrastructure at home .
The message emanating now from the US is not one of non @-@ interventionism , but a strategy of restraint that assumes that there are limits to American power and seeks to minimize the risk of entanglement in foreign conflicts .
As Gates put it in his West Point address , the US Army would no longer be &quot; a Victorian nation @-@ building constabulary designed to chase guerrillas , build schools , or sip tea . &quot;
The bad news is that Europe &apos;s feebleness and America &apos;s fatigue might also signal the limits of noble ideas such as the obligation to interfere in order to protect populations being brutalized by their own rulers .
America &apos;s reluctance to be drawn into the Libyan quagmire , and the West &apos;s failure to intervene in order to stop the Syrian army from massacring civilians , now looks like a sad , and fairly accurate , guide to the future .
Arafat \ u0027s Ghost
History gave Yasir Arafat far more time than most leaders to achieve his mission .
After all , at the time of his death he had been leader of the Palestinians for 35 years .
Yet he left his people in a terrible situation , with no state , in the midst of a losing war , and with a bankrupt economy .
Whether his successors can revive and complete the Palestinians &apos; historic mission depends on how they define their goal .
Looking back at his career , Arafat never really veered from the belief that his life &apos;s mission was to destroy Israel by any means necessary and replace it with a Palestinian Arab state .
An independent Palestinian state that did not include all of Israel held no appeal to him .
He was equally indifferent to his people &apos;s material welfare and anything particular about the design of a viable political and economic system .
Now , in the post @-@ Arafat era , Palestinians must choose one of several strategies .
Unfortunately , most of the alternatives call for the continued use of violence and terrorism .
The moderate strategy seeks an independent Palestine state as quickly as possible , on the assumption that once there is no more Israeli presence or violence , the Palestinians can concentrate on constructive pursuits , including resettling refugees and improving living standards .
But this is the view of only a small minority of leaders , notably former Prime Minister Abu Mazin and Muhammad Dahlan , who heads his own militia in the Gaza Strip .
If Arafat had taken this road - accepting Israel &apos;s existence , ending terrorism , and confronting Palestinian extremists - the conflict would have ended long ago .
But , with no single all @-@ powerful leader , it will be hard for any successor to force through the difficult decisions required by such an orientation .
The
The younger generation of indigenous West Bank Palestinians , whose leaders began political activity in the uprising of the late 1970 &apos;s , embraces a
The militants argue that a two @-@ stage strategy is needed to defeat Israel .
First , long @-@ term continuation of violence will force Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories .
Then , with Palestinians gaining the upper hand , they can advance to a second stage in which all of Israel is conquered , implying armed struggle - which often takes the form of anti @-@ civilian terrorism - for many more years .
Finally , there is the
The problem for Palestinian moderates is clear : any leader willing to agree a peace treaty with Israel would be opposed - passionately and even violently - by roughly 80 % of the movement .
A key question is whether the Palestinian masses , fed up with their leadership &apos;s bickering , corruption , and incompetence , could make their wishes known to find an end to a conflict that has cost them so much .
But none of the main leadership factions are proposing that the masses be consulted very much .
Nor did Arafat leave in place any institutional mechanisms for doing so .
Moreover , the popular appeal of radical religion , ideology , and misinformation should not be underestimated .
Few Palestinians are even aware that four years ago Arafat turned down an independent state equal in size to the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip , in addition to more than $ 20 billion in refugee compensation .
The main problem left by Arafat is the lack of any leadership at all .
Rarely in history has a political movement been so deliberately set by its founder on a course toward chaos .
Arafat not only left no successor , but no order .
Over the decades , the movement has developed a political culture of indiscipline .
Arafat presided over a sort of anarchy , encouraging rivalries , undermining other potential leaders , and ensuring that all authority ( and money ) ran through his hands .
Only if the post @-@ Arafat movement decides that it really wants a Palestinian state in exchange for ending the conflict with Israel in every respect will there be a real chance of peace .
Arafat &apos;s death may well mark the beginning of that process , but the transition to a new Palestinian leadership could take years , and there is no assurance that it will be a moderate one .
Arafat &apos;s Last Hurrrah
In his protracted moment of death , Yasir Arafat performed his last act of duty to the Palestinian cause to which he devoted his entire life .
Everything about the man was , indeed , protracted .
He carried out a protracted war of national liberation .
He withstood a series of protracted sieges - in Amman ( 1970 ) , Beirut ( 1982 ) , and in Ramallah ( 2002 @-@ 2004 ) .
Arafat &apos;s leadership was the most protracted among his counterparts in the Arab World , as he outlived three Egyptian Presidents ( Naguib , Nasser , Sadat and spanned all of Mubarak &apos;s quarter of a century ) , five Lebanese Presidents , three Iraqis , five Algerians , three Syrians , three Saudi Monarchs , and two in Morocco , not to mention other world leaders , from Eisenhower to Bush in the US , from de Gaulle to Chirac in France , and from Maó to three successors in China .
Probably no other political figure alive today met and endured as many world leaders as Arafat .
But there is much more to Arafat &apos;s legacy than endurance .
It has been correctly said over and again that Arafat was a mixed blessing for his people .
Their fate and destiny have been inextricably linked , to the near demise of both at times .
For several decades after the usurpation of their homeland , Palestinians were reduced to aggregates of refugees , some remaining in the newly @-@ created state of Israel as second @-@ class citizens , with others scattered over the Arab World and far beyond .
It was Yasir Arafat , through the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) he founded , that gave them a sense of identity as a people .
Regardless of its effectiveness , the armed struggle waged by the PLO did empower the Palestinians and internalize a sense of collective dignity and self respect within them .
Their cause could no longer be ignored .
No other modern issue has appropriated as many UN resolutions or as much international diplomacy .
If politics is defined as the art of compromise , Arafat was a master of it at the Palestinian and Arab levels .
He managed to stay at the helm for over forty years with no serious challengers .
Internationally , however , he was out of step with the post Cold War era .
Whether or not he was solely to blame , a true opportunity for historical compromise was missed at Camp David in August 2000 , and he himself acknowledged it a year later .
By that time it was too late , as the leadership in both the US and Israel had changed and there was no interest to engage him .
During the last four years of his life , Arafat &apos;s public space was literally and metaphorically diminishing .
He was unable to re @-@ engage his Israeli adversaries or control his suicide @-@ bound Palestinian militants .
Nor was he able to contain let alone combat rampant corruption in the Palestinian Authority .
Nor was Arafat helped by world events that shifted the spotlight to Bush &apos;s wars on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq .
If anything , they had adverse effects for him and his life @-@ long cause .
Like his own body , Arafat &apos;s familiar world was steadily fading away with irreversible loss of control .
Ironically however , as he was dying , world leaders and the media were rediscovering the importance of Arafat &apos;s leadership if not his persona .
The sustained focus of the media on him , to the point of near saturation , focused world attention on the Palestinian Question once again .
Statements by Tony Blair , Jacques Chirac , Kofi Annan and others on the occasion of Arafat &apos;s death have been forceful in demanding a speedy and long overdue resolution of the conflict .
It is as if in death , Arafat has given his people a chance to achieve what he could not achieve in life -the dream of an independent democratic Palestinian state .
It is Arafat &apos;s last hurrah .
Are Bad Banks a Good Idea ?
STOCKHOLM - The idea of a &quot; bad bank &quot; appears to grow more popular by the day in countries where toxic assets have paralyzed lending .
The Swedish bank cleanup in the early 1990 &quot; s is often cited as an example of how successful this idea can be .
But the lessons that are sometimes derived from Sweden &apos;s experience are based on misunderstandings of what we actually did , and of how our system worked .
The initiative to set up a &quot; bad bank &quot; in Sweden was taken not by politicians , but by the management of Nordbanken .
Following years of mismanagement and reckless lending , the bank was the first big victim of the commercial property market &apos;s decline in 1990 .
Nordbanken had become fully state @-@ owned and a new management was put in place to restore the bank to viability .
But it soon turned out that the managers had little time to spend on Nordbanken &apos;s core banking business , because they had to focus disproportionately on handling an enormous variety of assets .
And every quarter brought new write @-@ offs that ruined efforts to rebuild the bank &apos;s reputation and its employees &quot; morale .
The radical solution was to separate all the assets that were alien to the bank &apos;s core business , mainly real estate companies , but also firms in the manufacturing , construction , and service industries .
The &quot; bad bank &quot; that was established for this purpose , Securum , needed an enormous injection of capital from the owner , the Swedish government .
But Securum was then able to recruit skilled staff members who could maximize the assets &quot; value when markets recovered , and to be in a financial position to await that recovery .
The rest of Nordbanken , now known as Nordea , proceeded to become the largest bank in Scandinavia .
In contrast to today &apos;s situation , the bad assets were usually entire companies , not complex securities .
But , as with today &apos;s toxic assets , there was no market , and rapid disinvestment would have triggered fire @-@ sale prices , depressing all asset values in the economy and resulting in more bank failures .
Furthermore , the point was not to help private banks get rid of their troubled assets .
When most other Swedish banks followed Nordbanken &apos;s example and established their own bad banks , they did so without state participation .
But this was possible only because the Swedish government already owned all the assets , thereby circumventing the hopelessly difficult issue of pricing them .
With a private owner , huge public subsidies would have been politically unacceptable .
The assets either would have to be priced at far above their market value , with taxpayers thereby subsidizing the previous , failed owners , or the private bank would not have been helped at all .
A government @-@ sponsored bad bank for private assets is thus a very bad idea .
In 1994 , when I became State Secretary for Financial Affairs in Sweden &apos;s Ministry of Finance , recovery appeared to be on the horizon , following the abolition of the fixed exchange rate , the ensuing sharp depreciation of the Krona , and lower interest rates .
The new government implemented an effective and very big program to close a budget deficit of roughly 12 % of GDP .
Gradually , confidence grew , and financial markets began to function again .
As opportunities appeared , we began to re @-@ privatize assets , and within a few years Securum was closed .
With hindsight , I believe we sold its assets too quickly .
Taxpayers could have recovered more of their losses if we had been more patient , as prices continued to rise for a long time .
But the stigma of socialism was stronger than the instinct to make a profit .
The following lessons of Sweden &apos;s experience seem relevant today :
· A bad bank can be an effective instrument in the recovery of losses and the revival of banks .
· Although Sweden &apos;s experience concerned shares in companies used as collateral for credit , rather than bonds or similar financial instruments , this situation will likely arise in many countries today as the crisis continues , more companies go bankrupt , and banks recall their collateral and take possession of shares in indebted companies .
· Government subsidies for private bad banks , or public bad banks to clean up private banks &quot; toxic assets , are a bad way for taxpayers to transfer money to troubled banks compared to normal capital injections .
All subsidies should be transparent , and public / private bad banks are not .
· It is vital to staff bad banks with professional and experienced managers who are untainted by previous scandals .
Here , Sweden &apos;s experience is encouraging .
It was easier than we expected to recruit good people for Securum , because working in the public interest for this pioneering state @-@ owned bad bank was perceived as a unique challenge .
· Maximizing taxpayers &quot; economic interests , not ideology or political considerations , must be the guiding principle .
The public should be in no doubt about this , for their trust is essential .
Are Bankers Really Overpaid ?
LONDON - Are financial sector workers paid too much ?
Not all of them are , of course , for there are poorly paid bank clerks and cleaners who count in this category . But is it possible to justify the enormous rewards earned - or should we say received - by investment bankers , hedge fund managers and private equity partners ?
Most people would easily and quickly answer &quot; no . &quot;
Certainly that is what Congressmen in the US , and Members of Parliament in the UK think .
They are trying to cook up ways to discipline financial firms , albeit without conspicuous success so far , as demonstrated by the large sums stashed away for employee compensation by Goldman Sachs after its most recent profitable quarter .
But what does it mean to say that financial folk are paid too much ?
By what measure , and in relation to whom are they overpaid ?
Like many other people , I tend to believe that anyone paid more than me is prima facie over @-@ rewarded , but I know this is not the most rigorous test I could apply .
Economists have been trying to produce more robust answers to those questions .
Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef , for the National Bureau of Economic Research , have looked at a hundred years of data in the US , for pay in finance , and in other occupations .
Their conclusions are fascinating .
They find that if you control for educational attainment and skills , financial jobs were highly paid until the Great Depression of the 1930s , higher than the quality of the people who held the jobs would imply .
Then from the Depression , and the introduction of new and tighter regulation , financial sector pay reverted to the norm , and remained there until around 1990 .
But from that date up to 2006 it raced ahead and , on average , employees in financial firms were paid between a third and a half more than similarly qualified counterparts elsewhere .
We just don &apos;t know yet whether the crisis will cause another reversion to the mean , but some downward adjustment looks likely .
So there is some basis for saying they are overpaid , but why ?
Philippon and Reshef argue that regulation , or deregulation is a big part of the story .
Deregulation increased the opportunities for innovation and trading , and for profit .
There is also evidence to support that proposition from the observable fact that rewards in the less regulated parts of the asset management sector- hedge funds etc- are typically higher than in Security and Exchange Commission regulated competitors .
But is this a good enough explanation ? As rewards went up , why did new competitors , prepared to undercut , fail to come into the market ?
In other parts of the economy , where we see excess returns , we usually look for some weakness in competition , or perhaps for the exploitation of insider information , which excludes new entrants .
That may be part of the story , but competition for talent and for customers seems intense between investment banks and others , yet they have collectively been extravagantly rewarded at the expense of those customers .
An alternative hypothesis , which seems to fit the facts , recently emerged from the Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Dysfunctionality in Capital Markets , at the London School of Economics .
Researchers there argue that in fragile speculative industries ( and finance has certainly been in that category in recent years ) it is hard for investors to monitor those who manage their money .
They can see short @-@ term returns , but they do not understand very well how those returns are generated .
Managers can demand higher and higher returns in the upturn .
But eventually these high returns reduce the payouts to investors ( Bernie Madoff may be the reduction
If this explanation is broadly correct ( and it incorporates the deregulation point as well , as you can see ) then what can be done about it ?
Politicians and regulators are exploring a number of options , from higher tax rates , through fines for certain types of bonus arrangements , to variable capital requirements .
Higher taxes may be justified for other reasons , but are unlikely to solve the problem described .
Regulators have struggled with the problem for years without finding a solution .
The Bank of England has described the way in which remuneration policy can create risks for banks and said that , as a result , &quot; it is of increasing interest and concern to supervisors and regulators . &quot; But that was written in 1997 , and progress since then has been very slow , on both sides of the Atlantic .
Shouldn &apos;t shareholders take more of an interest ?
After all , it is their money which is at stake .
They have earned low returns from financial sector investments , indeed those returns have been very strongly negative in the last two years .
Shareholders seem to take little interests in pay policy .
The arrival of &quot; say on pay &quot; provisions in the US - whereby boards will need to put their compensation policies to a shareholder vote in future- may focus minds , though the impact of similar provisions in the UK has been modest .
Yet without shareholder pressure , all the signs are that the problem will persist .
What Good Are Economists ?
NEW HAVEN - Since the global financial crisis and recession of 2007 @-@ 2009 , criticism of the economics profession has intensified .
The failure of all but a few professional economists to forecast the episode - the aftereffects of which still linger - has led many to question whether the economics profession contributes anything significant to society .
If they were unable to foresee something so important to people &apos;s wellbeing , what good are they ?
Indeed , economists failed to forecast most of the major crises in the last century , including the severe 1920 @-@ 21 slump , the 1980 @-@ 82 back @-@ to @-@ back recessions , and the worst of them all , the Great Depression after the 1929 stock @-@ market crash .
In searching news archives for the year before the start of these recessions , I found virtually no warning from economists of a severe crisis ahead .
Instead , newspapers emphasized the views of business executives or politicians , who tended to be very optimistic .
The closest thing to a real warning came before the 1980 @-@ 82 downturn . In 1979 , Federal Reserve Chair Paul A. Volcker told the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress that the United States faced &quot; unpleasant economic circumstances , &quot; and had a &quot; need for hard decisions , for restraint , and even for sacrifice . &quot;
The likelihood that the Fed would have to take drastic steps to curb galloping inflation , together with the effects of the 1979 oil crisis , made a serious recession quite likely .
Nonetheless , whenever a crisis loomed in the last century , the broad consensus among economists was that it did not .
As far as I can find , almost no one in the profession - not even luminaries like John Maynard Keynes , Friedrich Hayek , or Irving Fisher - made public statements anticipating the Great Depression .
As the historian Douglas Irwin has documented , a major exception was the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel .
In a series of lectures at Columbia University in 1928 , Cassel warned of &quot; a prolonged and worldwide depression . &quot;
But his rather technical discussion ( which focused on monetary economics and the gold standard ) forged no new consensus among economists , and the news media reported no clear sense of alarm .
Interestingly , contemporary news accounts reveal little evidence of public anger at economists after disaster struck in 1929 .
So why has the failure to foresee the latest crisis turned out so differently for the profession ?
Why has it - unlike previous forecasting failures - stoked so much mistrust of economists ?
One reason may be the perception that many economists were smugly promoting the &quot; efficient markets hypothesis &quot; - a view that seemed to rule out a collapse in asset prices .
Believing that markets always know best , they dismissed warnings by a few mere mortals ( including me ) about overpricing of equities and housing .
After both markets crashed spectacularly , the profession &apos;s credibility took a direct hit .
But this criticism is unfair .
We do not blame physicians for failing to predict all of our illnesses .
Our maladies are largely random , and even if our doctors cannot tell us which ones we will have in the next year , or eliminate all of our suffering when we have them , we are happy for the help that they can provide .
Likewise , most economists devote their efforts to issues far removed from establishing a consensus outlook for the stock market or the unemployment rate .
And we should be grateful that they do .
In his new book Trillion Dollar Economists , Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution argues that the economics profession has &quot; created trillions of dollars of income and wealth for the United States and the rest of the world . &quot;
That sounds like a nice contribution for a relatively small profession , especially if we do some simple arithmetic .
There are , for example , only 20,000 members of the American Economic Association ( of which I am President @-@ Elect ) ; if they have created , say , $ 2 trillion of income and wealth , that is about $ 100 million per economist .
A cynic might ask , &quot; If economists are so smart , why aren &apos;t they the richest people around ? &quot; The answer is simple : Most economic ideas are public goods that cannot be patented or otherwise owned by their inventors .
Just because most economists are not rich does not mean that they have not made many people richer .
The fun thing about Litan &apos;s book is that he details many clever little ideas about how to run businesses or to manage the economy better .
They lie in the realm of optimal pricing and marketing mechanisms , regulation of monopolies , natural @-@ resource management , public @-@ goods provision , and finance .
None of them is worth even a trillion dollars , but , taken together , Litan &apos;s conclusion is plausible indeed .
The 2010 book Better Living through Economics , edited by John Siegfried , emphasizes the real @-@ world impact of such innovations : emissions trading , the earned @-@ income tax credit , low trade tariffs , welfare @-@ to @-@ work programs , more effective monetary policy , auctions of spectrum licenses , transport @-@ sector deregulation , deferred @-@ acceptance algorithms , enlightened antitrust policy , an all @-@ volunteer military , and clever use of default options to promote saving for retirement .
The innovations described in Litan &apos;s and Siegfried &apos;s books show that the economics profession has produced an enormous amount of extremely valuable work , characterized by a serious effort to provide genuine evidence .
Yes , most economists fail to predict financial crises - just as doctors fail to predict disease .
But , like doctors , they have made life manifestly better for everyone .
Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome ?
World flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) have soared over the past two decades , from $ 40 billion in the early 1980 &quot; s to $ 900 billion last year .
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $ 10 trillion , making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets : sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $ 19 trillion , compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion .
At the same time , the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries has been a driving force of intra @-@ firm trade - the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one @-@ third of world trade .
But are the good times coming to an end ?
FDI can bring a range of benefits , but it also can have costs .
During the 1970 &quot; s , when the transnational corporations ( TNC &apos;s ) undertaking such investment caught the public eye , many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits , so they controlled it .
Led by the developed countries , the pendulum began to swing in the 1980 &quot; s .
Once viewed as part of the problem , FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development .
Nothing exemplifies this more than changes in national FDI regimes .
As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reports , of the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004 , 93 % were in the direction of creating a more hospitable environment for TNC &apos;s .
But there is a real danger that the pendulum is beginning to swing back , leading to a reversal of that liberalization process .
FDI in developed countries ( and increasingly in emerging markets ) often takes the form of cross @-@ border mergers and acquisitions ( M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s ) .
Resistance to such M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s is becoming more frequent when they involve domestic firms that are regarded by politicians as &quot; national champions &quot; or important for national security , economic development , or cultural identity .
The growing involvement of private equity groups in M &amp; amp ; A activity implies additional controversy , as such transactions are typically regarded as being purely speculative .
In the name of &quot; economic patriotism , &quot; security , and other considerations , resistance to M &amp; amp ; A &apos;s is being codified in an increasing number of countries .
For example , a United States Senate committee recently sought to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines , while Europe has enacted more restrictive takeover laws .
Moreover , governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign firms .
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC &apos;s from emerging markets , the &quot; new kids on the block . &quot;
Established TNC &apos;s , and their home countries , will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market .
As we know from other contexts , adjustment to newcomers is not easy : compare , say , the reaction to the tie @-@ up between France &apos;s Alcatel and America &apos;s Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor .
Another type of defensive reaction - this time to outward FDI - may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed .
All indications are that offshoring has reached the tipping point , and more of it will take place through FDI .
If home countries do not put in place the adjustment mechanisms to deal with the rapidly unfolding revolution in making service industry jobs tradable , a backlash against such outward FDI will become inevitable .
The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries .
But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets .
In the case of large @-@ scale projects , some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNC &apos;s , and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that they did not get a fair deal .
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects , some two @-@ thirds were initiated during the past three years .
Approaches to FDI have changed in the past , and they can change again in the future , depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits .
This balance involves not only economic factors , but also such considerations as security and the desire to control one &apos;s own economic development .
The concept of &quot; twenty @-@ first @-@ century nationalization , &quot; introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala , mirrors in this respect the &quot; economic patriotism &quot; of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin .
Reservations against FDI ( as against anything foreign ) can be found in all groups of countries , and politicians can bring them to the surface , resulting in protectionism .
It would be ironic , though , if developed countries - which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades - now led a backlash against FDI .
Let us hope that the de @-@ liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all .
Are Housing Prices a House of Cards ?
The first big city to boom was London , starting around 1996 .
Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles , New York , and Sydney around 1997 , to Paris in 1998 , to Miami , Moscow , and Shanghai in 2001 , and Vancouver around 2002 .
These and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since ; prices in most are up at least 50 % in real terms since 2000 .
This has been a big windfall to homeowners , but has hurt anyone planning to buy .
Now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities .
The rate of price growth in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year , to only about a 1 % real increase in the second quarter of 2004 .
In Sydney , home prices actually fell in the second quarter .
Has the boom ended ?
Will no other cities benefit ?
Worse still , could the mood in housing markets soon lead prices in downward ?
No one predicted this boom , so predicting its end is risky .
Housing prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the party is over .
Any prediction concerning the boom &apos;s end requires understanding why it occurred in so many places .
Surprisingly , there is no well @-@ received explanation , because this boom &apos;s ultimate causes are mostly psychological .
Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics - factors that are concrete and knowable .
Of course , these indicators do have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets , but they are simply not adequate to account for the recent booms .
Three psychological causes stand out : first , a change in people &apos;s perceptions about the source of value in a changing world economy ; second , increasing public faith in &quot; glamour &quot; cities with international name recognition ; and third , the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles .
Each factor deserves greater attention if we are to understand current housing market conditions and discern future price trends .
First , the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago .
The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure , spurring a &quot; flight to quality &quot; - in this case , housing .
Moreover , terrorism is now viewed as a problem for everyone , with major tragedies in Indonesia , Spain , and Russia .
People feel safest investing in their homes , and there is little reason to expect imminent change .
Fear and upward momentum in home prices go together .
Second , the public &apos;s faith in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications due to the Internet and the cell phone .
Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities , so they believe that world famous centers of business , technology , and culture - whose names are household words to people everywhere - are uniquely valuable .
As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities , geographical celebrity appears resilient , if not self @-@ reinforcing : the more famous New York , Paris , and London get , the more glamorous they become .
Third , and no less important , is the speculative contagion that underlies any bubble .
The current boom has seen contagion
In contrast to the other two psychological causes , speculative contagion has a natural end .
A speculative bubble , sustaining itself solely by reaction to price increases , cannot go on forever .
So , where does this leave us ?
Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued upward momentum in housing prices , while the third suggests that the momentum will come to an end some day , but does not pinpoint when .
I am betting that some high @-@ flying glamour cities will continue to see decelerating growth in home prices - and eventually decreases .
Historically , housing prices have shown a lot of momentum , and prices in all these cities are still going up at a brisk rate , though usually somewhat slower than a year or more ago .
Based on extrapolation of growth trends , it looks safe to predict that prices will go up substantially in most of these places for another year or more , even as the rate of increase continues to decline .
The psychological factors are more important for longer @-@ term forecasts , beyond a year , where momentum no longer plays an important role .
At this point , there is likely to be some downward instability in prices , because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth .
Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession , or if the local economy suffers a severe shock , or if interest rates rise too fast .
Then , contagion within and across markets can work in a downward direction , propelling prices lower for years .
Are Human Rights Universal ?
Even in our globalizing world , the question as to whether &quot; human rights &quot; is an essentially Western concept , which ignores the very different cultural , economic , and political realities of the South , persists .
Can the values of a consumer society be applied to societies with nothing to consume ?
At the risk of sounding frivolous : When you stop a man in traditional dress from beating his wife , are you upholding her human rights or violating his ?
The fact is that a number of serious objections exist to the concept of universal human rights , which its defenders need to acknowledge - honestly - if only to refute them .
The first objection argues that all rights and values are defined and limited by cultural perceptions ; there is no universal culture , therefore there are no universal human rights .
Some philosophers object that the concept of human rights is founded on an individualistic view of man as an autonomous being whose greatest need is to be free from interference by the state , imbued , as it were , with the right to be left alone .
Non @-@ Western societies often espouse a communitarian ethic that sees society as more than the sum of its individual members , and considers duties to be more important than rights .
Then there is the usual North / South argument , with &quot; human rights &quot; cast as a cover for Western intervention in the developing world .
Developing countries , some also argue , cannot afford human rights , since the tasks of nation @-@ building and economic development remain unfinished ; suspending or limiting human rights thus sacrifices the few to benefit the many .
Others object to specific rights which they say reflect Western cultural bias , the most troublesome here being women &apos;s rights .
How can women &apos;s rights be universal when , in some societies , marriage is seen not as a contract between two individuals but as an alliance between lineages , and when the permissible behavior of women is central to a society &apos;s perception of familial honor ?
In addition , some religious leaders argue that human rights can be acceptable only if they are founded on the transcendent values of faith and are thus sanctioned by God .
There is a built @-@ in conflict between the universality of human rights and the particularity of religious perspectives .
How to respond to these objections ?
Concepts of justice and law , legitimacy and dignity , protection from oppressive rule , and participation in community affairs are found in every society ; the challenge facing human rights advocates is to identify the common denominators , and not throw up their hands at the impossibility of universalism .
These objections reflect a false opposition between the primacy of the individual and the paramountcy of society .
Culture is too often cited as a defence against human rights by authoritarians who crush culture whenever it suits them .
Besides , which country can claim to be following its pure &quot; traditional culture &quot; ?
You cannot follow the model of a &quot; modern &quot; nation @-@ state cutting across tribal boundaries and conventions , and then argue that tribal traditions should be applied to judge the state &apos;s human @-@ rights conduct .
There is nothing sacrosanct about culture anyway .
Culture constantly evolves in any living society , responding to both internal and external stimuli , and societies outgrow and reject much in every culture .
Let us concede that child marriage , female circumcision , and the like are not found reprehensible by many societies ; but let us also ask the victims of these practices how they feel .
Where coercion exists , rights are violated , and these violations must be condemned whatever the traditional justification .
Coercion , not culture , is the test .
As for religion , every religion embodies certain verities that are applicable to all mankind - justice , truth , mercy , compassion - and men often allow God to be blamed for their own sins .
As UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan put it , the problem is not with the faith , but with the faithful .
As for suspending human rights in the interests of development , authoritarianism promotes repression , not development .
Development is about change , but repression prevents change .
Though there may be cases where authoritarian societies had success in achieving economic growth , Botswana , an exemplar of African democracy , has grown faster than most authoritarian states .
A number of developing countries - notably India , China , Chile , Cuba , Lebanon , and Panama - played an active and influential part in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The principles of human rights have been widely adopted , imitated , and ratified by developing countries , so it is hardly fair to suggest that they have been imposed on them .
When one hears of the unsuitability or ethnocentricism of human rights , what are these human rights that someone in a developing country can do without ?
The right to life ?
Freedom from torture ?
The right not to be enslaved , not to be physically assaulted , not to be arbitrarily arrested , imprisoned , or executed ?
No one actually advocates the abridgement of any of these rights .
Objections to the applicability of human @-@ rights standards are all too frequently voiced by authoritarian rulers and power elites to rationalize violations that keep them in power .
Just as the Devil can quote scripture for his purpose , Third World communitarianism can be the slogan of a deracinated tyrant trained , as in the case of Pol Pot , at the Sorbonne .
The authentic voices of the South know how to cry out in pain .
Those are the voices that must be heeded .
Are Humans Getting Better ?
MELBOURNE - With daily headlines focusing on war , terrorism , and the abuses of repressive governments , and religious leaders frequently bemoaning declining standards of public and private behavior , it is easy to get the impression that we are witnessing a moral collapse .
But I think that we have grounds to be optimistic about the future .
Thirty years ago , I wrote a book called The Expanding Circle , in which I asserted that , historically , the circle of beings to whom we extend moral consideration has widened , first from the tribe to the nation , then to the race or ethnic group , then to all human beings , and , finally , to non @-@ human animals .
That , surely , is moral progress .
We might think that evolution leads to the selection of individuals who think only of their own interests , and those of their kin , because genes for such traits would be more likely to spread .
But , as I argued then , the development of reason could take us in a different direction .
On the one hand , having a capacity to reason confers an obvious evolutionary advantage , because it makes it possible to solve problems and to plan to avoid dangers , thereby increasing the prospects of survival .
Yet , on the other hand , reason is more than a neutral problem @-@ solving tool .
It is more like an escalator : once we get on it , we are liable to be taken to places that we never expected to reach .
In particular , reason enables us to see that others , previously outside the bounds of our moral view , are like us in relevant respects .
Excluding them from the sphere of beings to whom we owe moral consideration can then seem arbitrary , or just plain wrong .
Steven Pinker &apos;s recent book The Better Angels of Our Nature lends weighty support to this view . &amp; nbsp ; Pinker , a professor of psychology at Harvard University , draws on recent research in history , psychology , cognitive science , economics , and sociology to argue that our era is less violent , less cruel , and more peaceful than any previous period of human existence .
The decline in violence holds for families , neighborhoods , tribes , and states .
In essence , humans living today are less likely to meet a violent death , or to suffer from violence or cruelty at the hands of others , than their predecessors in any previous century .
Many people will doubt this claim .
Some hold a rosy view of the simpler , supposedly more placid lives of tribal hunter @-@ gatherers relative to our own .
But examination of skeletons found at archaeological sites suggests that as many as 15 % of prehistoric humans met a violent death at the hands of another person .
( For comparison , in the first half of the twentieth century , the two world wars caused a death rate in Europe of not much more than 3 % . )
Even those tribal peoples extolled by anthropologists as especially &quot; gentle &quot; - for example , the Semai of Malaysia , the Kung of the Kalahari , and the Central Arctic Inuit - turn out to have murder rates that are , relative to population , comparable to Detroit , which has one of the highest murder rates in the United States .
In Europe , your chance of being murdered is now less than one @-@ tenth , and in some countries only one @-@ fiftieth , of what it would have been had you lived 500 years ago .
Pinker accepts that reason is an important factor underlying the trends that he describes .
In support of this claim , he refers to the &quot; Flynn Effect &quot; - the remarkable finding by the philosopher James Flynn that since IQ tests were first administered , scores have risen considerably .
The average IQ is , by definition , 100 ; but , to achieve that result , raw test results have to be standardized .
If the average teenager today took an IQ test in 1910 , he or she would score 130 , which would be better than 98 % of those taking the test then .
It is not easy to attribute this rise to improved education , because the aspects of the tests on which scores have risen the most do not require a good vocabulary , or even mathematical ability , but instead assess powers of abstract reasoning .
One theory is that we have gotten better at IQ tests because we live in a more symbol @-@ rich environment .
Flynn himself thinks that the spread of the scientific mode of reasoning has played a role .
Pinker argues that enhanced powers of reasoning give us the ability to detach ourselves from our immediate experience and from our personal or parochial perspective , and frame our ideas in more abstract , universal terms .
This , in turn , leads to better moral commitments , including avoidance of violence .
It is just this kind of reasoning ability that improved during the twentieth century .
So there are grounds to believe that our improved reasoning abilities have enabled us to reduce the influence of those more impulsive elements of our nature that lead to violence .
Perhaps this underlies the significant drop in deaths inflicted by war since 1945 - a decline that has become even steeper over the past 20 years .
If so , there would be no denying that we continue to face grave problems , including of course the threat of catastrophic climate change .
But there would nonetheless be some reason to hope for moral progress .
Are Humans to Blame for Global Warming ?
Global warming is an environmental , economic , scientific , and political problem of the first order , and one doubly difficult to address because its dangers lie decades in the future .
So if we are to act now to head it off , we must first scrutinize what is known about the nature of the threat .
Should we place our faith in the Kyoto Treaty , which sets firm limits on human emissions of so @-@ called greenhouse gases ?
Or is the US administration right to reject the Kyoto Treaty , because targeting emissions is based on &quot; bad science &quot; ?
Circumstantial evidence does indeed point to our profligate burning of fossil fuels and perhaps also to its impact on global warming .
Since 1900 the global temperature of the Earth &apos;s atmosphere and ocean surface waters has risen by 0.5 @-@ 1 degree Celsius , and the prime suspect is atmospheric carbon dioxide , CO2 , which is second only to water vapor in its greenhouse effect .
Since 1860 , when the industrial revolution and soaring population growth led to widespread consumption of fossil fuels , the volume of atmospheric CO2 has increased by about 28 % .
The increase began slowly , rising from 290 parts per million in 1860 to 295 ppm in 1900 .
But it then accelerated rapidly , reaching 310 ppm in 1950 and 370 ppm in 2000 , with half of the total gain of 80 ppm occurring just since 1975 .
Numerical global climate models suggest that a doubling of the current atmospheric accumulation of CO2 will produce further warming of 3 @-@ 5 degrees Celsius , perhaps as soon as 2050 .
The consequences of this would be devastating : inland areas desiccated , low @-@ lying coastal regions battered and flooded as polar ice melts and sea levels rise , and possibly further warming and a runaway greenhouse effect due to an increase in atmospheric water vapor .
The only rational course of action would seem to be to curtail global consumption of fossil fuels , as the Kyoto Treaty &apos;s proponents contend , and invest in alternative energy sources .
But while researchers created impressive global climate models in recent years , they are the first to admit that such models can include only a fraction of the many physical forces that together determine the climate and global mean temperature .
For example , studies during the past 20 years have shown that changes in solar magnetic activity cause the Sun &apos;s brightness to vary by 0.1 % , and that the average annual temperature in the northern Temperate Zone has tracked the level of solar activity over the last 1,000 years .
Indeed , monitoring of other solar @-@ type stars has revealed one whose brightness decreased by 0.5 % in a period of 5 years , during which its magnetic activity declined sharply , suggesting that the Sun behaves similarly .
Core samples from the Greenland ice cap , for example , show occasional sudden drops in temperature .
Contrary to what climate models focusing on greenhouse gas emissions would predict , the samples show that a decline in atmospheric CO2 followed , rather than preceded , these frigid intervals .
What , then , is responsible for global warming so far ? A safe bet is that from 1900 until 1950 , global warming was driven mainly by the solar brightening , as solar magnetic activity increased by a factor of two or three during this period .
Atmospheric CO2 could not have been a major contributor , because it had increased by only about 7 % before 1950 , when the warming leveled off for a couple of decades . After 1950 , however , solar activity showed no significant rise , while atmospheric CO2 increased by 20 % , accounting for the warming from 1970 to 2000 .
Atmospheric CO2 is therefore presumably the controlling factor for the coming century as well .
But this does not mean that human emissions are responsible for the growing accumulation of atmospheric CO2 . The atmosphere contains about 750 gigatons of CO2 , while total annual human emission is approximately 5.5 Gt , thus adding annually roughly 0.7 % of the total .
However , there is also an estimated exchange of 90 Gt per year between the atmosphere and the oceans .
This means that Human CO2 emissions do not simply linger and accumulate in the atmosphere .
They are rapidly distributed to the ocean surface , so that atmospheric CO2 remains at an equilibrium level .
This equilibrium is , in turn , determined by the temperature of ocean surface water . So it is plausible that the solar @-@ driven ocean warming between 1900 and 1950 started things off by shifting the equilibrium toward higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere , accelerating global warming since then .
So , while our own contribution of CO2 is not helping matters , it hardly seems to be the determining factor . On the available evidence , then , skeptics of the Kyoto Treaty appear to have a powerful case .
Yet the threat posed by global warming is nonetheless real , and focusing on human CO2 emissions is not necessarily &quot; bad science , &quot; just incomplete science .
For example , aside from solar magnetic activity , the Sun affects the Earth &apos;s climate in several other ways , including ultraviolet warming of the upper stratosphere , the nucleation of aerosols , and cloud formation . The climate is also subject to the rate of water vapor exchange between the atmosphere and Earth &apos;s surface , which requires taking into account ocean currents , wind , and geography .
All of these contributing effects must be understood quantitatively in order to produce an accurate model of global climate change and we remain far from that point .
So the only rational response is to research aggressively into the many unknown factors : the physics of cloud formation , the dynamic coupling of the upper stratosphere to the lower atmosphere , the accumulation of atmospheric water vapor .
If effective solutions are to be found , they must await a fuller definition of the problem .
Are Israel and Syria Ready for Peace ?
JERUSALEM - The resumption of peace talks between Israel and Syria after eight years of saber @-@ rattling is not a diversion from the political troubles of Israel &apos;s lame @-@ duck prime minister .
Nor are the talks a Syrian ploy to avoid facing an international tribunal on the assassination of Lebanon &apos;s former prime minister , Rafik Hariri .
An Israeli @-@ Syrian peace deal is strategically vital for both sides , and both sides know it .
The two major formative experiences of Syria &apos;s Ba &apos;ath regime have been Hafez al @-@ Assad &apos;s loss of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war with Israel , and the loss of Lebanon by his son , Bashar , who was forced to withdraw his army under irresistible American @-@ led international pressure .
Recovering the Golan Heights and protecting Syria &apos;s vital interests in Lebanon are not only major strategic concerns for Syria &apos;s president ; they are also crucial to the regime &apos;s drive for national legitimacy , and to Bashar &apos;s assertion of his own leadership .
Peace with Israel is not Assad &apos;s priority .
Rather , it is the prerequisite without which superior goals - rapprochement with the United States , legitimization of Syria &apos;s special status in Lebanon , and avoidance of a potentially devastating war with Israel if the Golan Heights are not recovered by peaceful means - cannot be attained .
Indeed , the regime has hinted that it may be willing to compromise on the issue - the delineation of the 1967 border along a tiny piece of land on the Eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee - that wrecked the negotiations eight years ago .
An Israeli @-@ Syrian peace is a weighty strategic necessity for Israel , too .
The complexities of the threats to Israel are such that a possible confrontation with Hamas in Gaza might trigger a flare @-@ up with Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Such a war could be won only by the total destruction of Lebanon by Israel &apos;s air force .
In that case , Syria would likely seize the opportunity to break the deadlock over the Golan Heights through a military move that could develop into a massive war of missiles targeting Israel &apos;s vulnerable home front .
And Iran , in its drive to protect its nuclear program from an Israeli @-@ American attack , might be very active in supporting this ominous scenario .
Admittedly , the strategic conditions in the region are far more complex today than they were eight years ago , when Israel &apos;s requirements for a deal with Syria focused mainly on security arrangements on the Golan Heights , and on Syria using its leverage in Lebanon to permit an Israeli settlement with that country .
Syria &apos;s alliance with Iran was not a major issue .
Syria &apos;s subsequent forced withdrawal from Lebanon was not good news for Israel .
In the last round of Israeli @-@ Palestinian peace talks eight years ago , it was clear that a deal with Syria would automatically pave the way to a settlement with Lebanon , and an end to Hezbollah &apos;s threat to Israel &apos;s northern border .
Today , peace with Syria might facilitate an Israeli peace with Lebanon down the road , but that will not be an automatic outcome .
Indeed , while Hezbollah prospered under Syrian occupation , it never reached the extraordinary political power that it has today .
Nevertheless , peace with Syria could be a major building block in a wider Israeli @-@ Arab settlement , and consequently of a more stable Middle East , though it is unrealistic to expect that Syria would automatically sever its special relationship with Iran in exchange for the Golan Heights .
These are peace talks , not a defense treaty , and Syria would not abruptly disengage from its Iranian friends .
But good relations between an Arab state at peace with Israel and Iran are not necessarily a bad thing .
Syria &apos;s stance might limit , rather than extend , the reach of Iran &apos;s strategy of regional destabilization .
As always , much will depend on America &apos;s readiness to move away from military solutions and rigid ideological imperatives and instead embrace the pragmatic culture of conflict resolution .
A US @-@ backed Israeli @-@ Syrian peace could transform the strategic environment , potentially drawing other Middle East spoilers into a system of regional cooperation and security .
Violence and Innovation
ABU DHABI - In the 1949 British film The Third Man , the character Harry Lime observes that , during the Borgia family &apos;s rule in Renaissance Italy , the country &quot; had warfare , terror , murder , and bloodshed .
But &#91; it &#93; produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , and the Renaissance . &quot;
By contrast , he contends , Switzerland &apos;s 500 years of democracy and peace produced little more than the cuckoo clock .
While the implication that innovation and creativity are born only of conflict is extreme - in fact , Switzerland is a world leader in innovation - Lime makes a crucial point .
Although peace , order , and political stability are widely perceived as essential prerequisites for invention , entrepreneurship , and economic development , there have been many exceptions to this rule - especially when it comes to creativity and innovation .
The United States is consistently ranked among the world &apos;s top ten countries for innovation , including by INSEAD &apos;s Global Innovation Index .
But , on the Global Peace Index , it is ranked 88th of 153 countries .
Likewise , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands rank , respectively , fifth and sixth on the Innovation Index , but only 28th and 29th on the Peace Index .
Conversely , Bhutan is among the top 20 most peaceful nations , but does not even make it onto innovation indices .
Of course , crime , terrorism , conflict , and political instability severe enough to cause a total breakdown of law and order significantly impede creativity and innovation .
But some countries show strong resilience in the face of pervasive violence and volatility .
For example , despite widespread violent crime , Mexico and South Africa have high levels of innovation ( measured by patent filing and trademark registration ) .
When terrorism indicators are taken into account , Lebanon , Turkey , Jordan , and Israel emerge as resilient innovators .
Just as peace and stability do not always lead to creativity and innovation , fighting and uncertainty do not necessarily deter it .
Although peace , political stability , and civil order are important factors to consider when selecting a location for a large @-@ scale foreign production or service operation , they are far less important when it comes to sourcing creativity and making the related investments .
In particular , creative industries , such as animation , arts , design , and software - which are mostly based on individual skills and talent - tend to be more resilient to conflict than others .
Given this , officials , investors , and business leaders in search of revolutionary ideas , cutting @-@ edge solutions , and untapped talent should not allow turbulence in some societies , or tranquility in others , to influence their decisions excessively .
In fact , stepping out of one &apos;s comfort zone may offer significant benefits .
Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of uncertainty may boost competition , thereby sparking innovation .
Furthermore , social environments that are characterized by lower levels of consensus and higher levels of violence may be more likely than their more harmonious counterparts to catalyze radical innovation .
Lebanon &apos;s experience supports this assessment .
Despite its long history of political violence , its creative industries are expanding .
According to a 2007 study of Lebanon &apos;s copyright @-@ based industries , conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization , the main challenges facing the country &apos;s software sector - an important part of its economy - include restricted markets , intense competition , a brain drain ( loss of human capital ) , inadequate technology policy , a lack of government incentives , and rampant piracy .
Violence is conspicuously absent from the list .
To be sure , violence is always a problem .
But countries like Lebanon have become resistant to its effects - for example , by developing creative industries - diminishing its negative impact on economic , social , and intellectual development .
In 2005 , 10 % of all new businesses in Lebanon were in the creative sector , and the copyright @-@ based industries contributed 4.75 % of GDP .
Similarly , despite high levels of political violence , Nigeria produces more than 1,000 films annually .
Indeed , Nigeria &apos;s film industry is the world &apos;s third largest , after the US and India , and is second only to oil production in terms of its economic significance to the country .
According to a 2010 United Nations report on the creative economy , global trade in creative goods grew at an annual rate of 14 % from 2002 to 2008 .
Meanwhile , exports of such goods from developing countries , which tend to experience more violence , grew at a rate of 13.5 % , reaching $ 176 billion ( 43 % of total world trade in creative industries ) in 2008 .
Although overall global trade declined by 12 % that year , trade in creative goods and services continued to expand .
This has significant implications for political and business leaders - especially in turbulent regions like the Middle East .
In order to bolster economic growth and innovation amid conflict and volatility , policymakers and investors should focus on building the creative industries .
The resilience and adaptability that they provide are crucial to supporting long @-@ term economic growth and job creation - no matter what the future brings .
Are Sanctions Saving Russia ?
MOSCOW - The economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West in March 2014 have undoubtedly been painful .
But they have so far failed to achieve the goal of weakening Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s position .
In fact , they may have the opposite effect , leaving Russia - and its president - even stronger than before .
European Union countries are estimated to have lost about $ 100 billion in trade with Russia , hitting the likes of Bavarian dairy farmers and eastern German industrial exporters .
Russian GDP , which grew modestly in 2014 , contracted by 4.6 % in annual terms in the second quarter of this year .
The ruble lost more than half of its US dollar value in the second half of last year , fueling inflation , which increased by 15.6 % year on year in July .
But inflation now seems to have peaked , and the effects of the drop in oil and gas prices were mitigated by the US dollar &apos;s appreciation , so that the value of Russia &apos;s foreign reserves actually increased , reaching $ 362 billion in June ( 13 % of which is in gold ) .
And despite belt @-@ tightening in Russia , Putin is more popular than ever .
The rationale behind economic sanctions is straightforward : free trade and free markets deliver growth ( and thus political support for the government ) , whereas restrictions choke off growth ( and thus erode support for the government ) .
This emphasis on free trade and free markets was a central tenet of nineteenth @-@ century British classical economics .
It remains a core message of today &apos;s dominant neoclassical school - embodied in the so @-@ called &quot; Washington Consensus , &quot; adopted across the world under the International Monetary Fund &apos;s advice - which claims that the key to economic development is to open up , deregulate , liberalize , and privatize .
But the theory is fundamentally flawed .
No economic power has ever developed solely on the basis of laissez @-@ faire policies .
The economic rise of the United Kingdom , for example , was heavily dependent on strategic protection , industrial policy , tariffs , and non @-@ tariff trade barriers .
The UK &apos;s industrial prowess originated with the textile industry .
The country &apos;s leaders realized that the export of raw materials , mainly wool , would be inadequate to spur economic development .
For that , England would have to move up the value @-@ added ladder , by importing raw materials and exporting finished goods .
So England &apos;s leaders devised an industrial policy , which entailed bringing in Flemish textile weavers to provide know @-@ how to British firms .
Moreover , they erected trade barriers : By banning the export of raw wool and the import of finished wool products , Indian textiles , which were often superior and cheaper , could not compete with domestic output .
They adopted navigation laws that restricted foreign ships &quot; access to British ports and even enacted a demand @-@ boosting law requiring the dead to be buried in woolens .
Ultimately , the mechanization of the textile industry ushered in the Industrial Revolution , and mass production and exports underpinned the development of the world &apos;s largest maritime fleet .
In the mid @-@ nineteenth century , the German economist Friedrich List highlighted the role that such policies played in the UK &apos;s development .
In line with his advice , the United States , Germany , and Japan employed judicious trade protection and industrial policies , while working actively to support nascent sectors - a strategy that enabled them to develop rapidly and even overtake Britain .
Restrictions also proved effective to spur economic development : In 1812 , when the UK declared war and imposed a trade embargo on the US , import substitution caused American manufacturing to flourish .
When the embargo was lifted and trade tariffs were reduced , US manufacturing floundered - until 1828 , when new British tariffs boosted US manufacturing again .
Likewise , during World War I , a British trade embargo spurred the development of German high @-@ tech industries due to the demand for substitutes .
Of course , embargoes can have a devastating effect when a country lacks the resources needed for import substitution .
That is why economic sanctions were so damaging for Iran and , earlier , for Iraq &apos;s population .
But , for a country like Russia , with its abundant natural resources , technological expertise , and skilled workforce , sanctions can have the opposite effect .
The Soviet Union struggled to capitalize on these factors , owing to communism &apos;s weak incentive structure .
Today , by contrast , Russia has a capitalist system that offers considerable benefits to those who adapt best to the restrictions .
In short , Russia has all it needs to thrive , despite - or because of - the sanctions .
But turning opportunity into reality requires Russia to pursue an economic transformation .
Neoclassical trade theory is based on the concept of comparative advantage : countries should capitalize on their relative strengths , from technological prowess to resource endowments .
But , as English leaders knew and as the experience of many African and Latin American countries has shown , simply exporting raw materials is inadequate to propel development .
Historically , the most effective development policy has centered on government intervention to establish higher @-@ value @-@ added domestic industries .
In previous decades , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , and China have all taken this path .
For Russia , moving up the value @-@ added ladder should not be difficult ; it has all it needs to manufacture the finished products that it previously imported .
In fact , import substitution has already increased productivity in several key sectors : engineering , petrochemicals , light industry , pharmaceuticals , and agriculture .
Annual exports of high @-@ value @-@ added goods rose by 6 % in the first quarter of this year .
Furthermore , Russia &apos;s leadership has accelerated cooperation with the other BRICS economies ( Brazil , India , China , and South Africa ) , and Putin recently announced ambitious plans to boost domestic demand .
The West &apos;s sanctions against Russia may not only fail to change the Ukraine situation ; they may well spur the country &apos;s long @-@ awaited structural transformation .
If Russia successfully replicates the credit @-@ guidance regime used by East Asia &apos;s economies , while increasing managerial efficiency , yet another economic miracle is possible .
Are Saudi Women Next ?
LONDON - The unexpected visibility and assertiveness of women in the revolutions unfolding across the Arab world - in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and elsewhere - has helped propel what has become variously known as the &quot; Arab awakening &quot; or &quot; Arab Spring . &quot;
Major changes have occurred in the minds and lives of women , helping them to break through the shackles of the past , and to demand their freedom and dignity .
Since January 2011 , images of millions of women demonstrating alongside men have been beamed around the world by television journalists , posted on YouTube , and splashed on the front pages of newspapers .
One saw women from all walks of life marching in hope of a better future , for themselves and for their countries .
They appeared prominently - eloquent and outspoken , marching daily , holding caricatures of dictators and chanting calls for democratic change .
They walked , bussed , traveled in carts , telephoned and tweeted with compatriots , motivated in part by social demands - above all for their own empowerment .
The contrast between this dynamic space for open protest and Saudi Arabia could hardly be starker .
Saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system .
Faces of the royal family are seen everywhere ; the faces of women are shrouded , forcibly hidden .
Nowhere else in the world do we see modernity experienced as such a problem .
Skyscrapers rise out of the desert , yet women are not permitted to ride with men in their lifts .
Nor are they allowed to walk in the streets , drive a car , or leave the country without the permission of a male guardian .
Fatima , a young woman from Mecca , sent me an email at the height of the Egyptian revolution : &quot; Forget about the cries for freedom ; I can &apos;t even give birth without being accompanied to hospital by a mihrim ( male guardian ) . &quot;
She went on , &quot; And the mataw &apos;a ( the religious police , known officially as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice , and whose leader has ministerial rank ) have been given the right to humiliate us in public . &quot;
Indeed , the mutaw &apos;a saw their wide powers enhanced even more by decrees issued by King Abdullah in March , after helping to suppress protests in the kingdom earlier in the month .
Yet globalization knows no limits , not even those set by the guardians of Islamic probity .
Nine @-@ year @-@ old Saudi girls chat online , disregarding fatwas issued by Wahhabi clerics that forbid them access to the Internet without the supervision of a male guardian .
Many women remain secretly glued to satellite television channels , watching their peers in the public squares of Egypt or Yemen , beyond their reach but not beyond their imagination .
On May 21 , a brave woman named Manal al Sharif broke the silence and apathy , daring to defy the ban on women driving .
For the next week , she sat in a Saudi prison .
But , within two days of her detention , 500,000 viewers had watched the YouTube video of her excursion .
Thousands of Saudi women , frustrated and humiliated by the ban , have vowed to stage a &quot; driving day &quot; on June 17 .
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that forbids women to drive cars .
The system of confinement that the ban represents is justified neither by Islamic texts , nor by the nature of the diverse society that the Al Saud and their Wahhabi partners &quot; rule .
Indeed , it is far removed even from the rest of the Arab world - which has become glaringly obvious in the context of massive social upheaval almost everywhere else in the region .
Enforced segregation is mirrored in every aspect of Saudi life .
Religious education constitutes up to 50 % of students &quot; curriculum .
As a result , Wahhabi dogma penetrates every home in the country .
Textbooks - pink for girls , blue for boys , each with different contents - emphasize the rules prescribed by Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab , an eighteenth @-@ century cleric and the founder of Wahhabism .
The Saudi judicial system is one of the most formidable obstacles to women &apos;s aspirations , relying on Islamic interpretations that protect a defensive patriarchal system .
Indeed , not only do judges &quot; decisions support the system , but the reverse is also true : patriarchy has become the driving force of the law .
Thus , Saudi women are barred from the legal profession on the basis of a Wahhabi stricture that &quot; a woman is lacking in mind and religion . &quot;
In other words , the rule of law in Saudi Arabia is the rule of misogyny - the comprehensive legal exclusion of women from the public sphere .
Saudi rulers have announced that demonstrations are haram - a sin punishable by jail and flogging .
Now some clerics have pronounced driving by women to be foreign @-@ inspired haram , punishable in the same way .
Yet , despite such threats , thousands of Saudi women joined &quot; We are all Manal al Sharif &quot; on Facebook , and countless other videos of women driving have appeared on YouTube since her arrest .
Like Mamal , they , too , have been detained , and the government appears determined to prosecute them .
But Wajeha al Huwaider , Bahia al Mansour , Rasha al Maliki , and many other activists are nonetheless insisting that driving a car is their legitimate right , and are eloquently demanding the removal of restrictions and an end to women &apos;s dependency .
Rosa Parks &quot; revolutionary bravery in refusing to move to the back of a Montgomery , Alabama municipal bus in 1955 helped spark the American civil rights movement .
We shall soon find out whether Manal al Sharif &apos;s defiance of the Saudi regime &apos;s systemic confinement of women produces a similar effect .
Are Terrorists Insane ?
ORLANDO - One of the most common popular misunderstandings about the causes of terrorism is the notion that terrorists must be &quot; insane &quot; to behave as they do .
That idea is as wrong as it is comforting .
Conservatives in the United States , for example , frequently rail against the &quot; madness &quot; of Islamic terrorists , and regard attempts to understand terrorism as appeasement or liberalism gone wild .
In the wake of September 11 , 2001 , in particular , many on the right mistook the attempt to understand or explain the terrorists &quot; actions as an effort to condone them .
We have been here before , though .
After World War II , the myth of the &quot; mad Nazi &quot; exerted a forceful grip upon the popular imagination ; surely , only insane individuals could perpetrate something like the Holocaust .
But social science research in the 1940 &quot; s and 1950 &quot; s , including interviews with surviving Nazi leaders , demonstrated that members of the German governmental hierarchy were not only sane , but also highly intelligent .
Moreover , by the early 1960 &quot; s , the social psychologist Stanley Milgram had shown that ordinary Americans would go to extraordinary lengths in obeying malevolent authority .
He famously induced people from a variety of social classes and occupations to administer what they thought were increasingly harsh electrical shocks to a helpless victim ( played by an actor ) sitting in an adjoining room , and his findings have since been replicated around the world .
This was an unpalatable conclusion .
Faced with the horror of what the Nazis had done , most people found it psychologically easier to think of what had happened as the behavior of mentally unhinged individuals , or the result of some sort of collective fugue .
But had vast numbers of Germans suddenly lost their senses overnight , or were they part of a situation in which most of us would simply have done as we were told ?
A similar resistance to noisome conclusions - and similarly understandable from a psychological viewpoint - informs today &apos;s thinking about terrorists .
Our default reaction , often reinforced by Western philosophical traditions and simplistic political rhetoric , is that evil acts must be the product of fundamentally evil or insane individuals .
As with the Nazis , the study of modern terrorism began from the starting position that a single disposition - known in the literature as the &quot; terrorist personality &quot; - characterizes most or all terrorists .
In the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , West German authorities allowed psychologists and psychiatrists to interview terrorism suspects then being held in prison or awaiting trial , including members of the Red Army Faction .
A brigade of experts descended on the jails , looking for evidence to justify their own pet theories of terrorist psychology .
Terrorists were all self @-@ serving narcissists , some found after the interviews were done .
Others argued that terrorists were all victims of clinical paranoia or some other psychosis .
Some even suggested , somewhat bizarrely , that terrorists tend to have lost a parent in their childhood years and are acting out the aggression that derives from their resulting frustration with life .
All of these views shared the belief that there was something fundamentally dysfunctional about the &quot; terrorist personality , &quot; something warped and unusual that sets &quot; them &quot; apart from &quot; us . &quot;
Never mind that different researchers found different features of this so @-@ called personality salient , and came to fundamentally different conclusions about it .
In the years since , social science has reinforced skepticism that all terrorists share such essential personality traits .
There is also a growing recognition that the social circumstances to which terrorists are exposed play a significant role .
What we know about the mindset of terrorists tells us that they are mostly not deranged or insane , but have acquired a different set of beliefs and been exposed to social conditions very different from our own .
Put simply , the causes of terror are largely situational , and the situations are themselves as varied as the acts themselves ( members of the IRA , for instance , have obviously been exposed to circumstances very different from members of Al Qaeda ) .
It must be admitted , of course , that our access to real @-@ life terrorists is limited , and we still have much to learn about the kind of environments that foster terroristic behavior .
Arguably , our knowledge of the factors that led to the July 2005 bombings in London , for example , is still far less impressive than our ignorance .
The great contribution of social science to the understanding of human evil has been to expose unpalatable truths .
When we resort to psychologically comforting but misleading assumptions about terrorism , we hamper our own understanding of political violence in general - and hence weaken our ability to avert or minimize it .
Are the Barbarians at the EU Gates ?
BRUSSELS - The euro area confronts a fundamental crisis that attacks on financial speculators will do nothing to resolve .
The European Council of Ministers had to promise hundreds of billions of euros to its financially imperiled member countries , even though the European economy as a whole is not really in crisis .
On the contrary , most surveys and hard economic indicators point to a strong upswing , with the one country that is in really serious trouble , Greece , representing only 3 % of the area &apos;s GDP .
Nevertheless , the crisis poses an almost existential challenge to the European Union - and has required such huge sums - because it directly implicates the key underlying principle of European governance : the nature of the state .
The case of Greece has raised the simple but profound question : can a member state of the EU be allowed to fail ?
One view is that the state is sacrosanct : the EU has to intervene and help any errant member to get back on its feet .
But this view assumes that all member states adhere to the Union &apos;s underlying economic values of fiscal prudence and market reform .
Problems could arise only because of unanticipated shocks , temporary local political difficulties , and - the favorite culprit - irrational markets .
Applied to Greece , this view implies that the country &apos;s fiscal crisis resulted from an overreaction by world financial markets to local political difficulties ( excessive spending by the Greek government before last year &apos;s elections ) .
Moreover , it implies that the crisis is fully under European control , and that the European authorities have elaborated a comprehensive plan that will resolve all of Greece &apos;s fiscal and structural problems .
Hence the official - let &apos;s say &quot; Southern &quot; - refrain : &quot; The IMF / EU plan will succeed .
Failure is not an option . &quot;
The alternative view is more pragmatic and rules @-@ based .
This &quot; Northern &quot; view starts from the premise that member states remain sovereign units , and that it is possible that a member country does not implement a necessary economic @-@ adjustment program .
This view is embodied in the &quot; no bailout &quot; clause in the euro &apos;s founding document , which stipulates that each country is responsible for its own public debt .
Failure then becomes an option if the country concerned violates the single currency &apos;s basic rules .
Financial markets do not participate directly in this debate .
But they have much skin in this game .
Any holder of Greek debt , especially long @-@ term debt , must calculate the likelihood that Greece &apos;s political system will prove strong enough to push through the reforms needed to enable the country to service its debt fully ( and on time ) .
The collective judgment of financial markets on any government &apos;s economic and fiscal policy is expressed in the risk premium that the government must pay on its external debt .
Doubts in financial markets lead to higher risk premia , which make it even more difficult to finance a government that is already facing financial problems .
Financial markets are often wrong in their judgments .
But they are a fact of life that cannot just be wished or regulated away .
One might object that the distinction between Southern and Northern views is academic nowadays , because failure really isn &apos;t an option , given that it would trigger a disastrous reaction in global financial markets .
But the European Council also created a Task Force under President Herman Van Rompuy to elaborate concrete proposals for reforming the monetary union .
The key choice for this group is simple : should they direct their efforts solely at preventing failure ( including open @-@ ended fiscal support ) , or should they also prepare for the failure of a member state in order to mitigate the consequences if that should happen ?
The first choice is bound to imply elaborate measures designed to deliver &quot; more of the same &quot; - a strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact , for example , with more provisions for economic policy surveillance and cooperation .
But this approach has no answer to the fundamental question : What if the framework does not work ?
So long as EU leaders cannot answer that question , financial markets will continue to harbor doubts about the euro &apos;s long @-@ term stability .
The eurozone cannot stabilize in political and economic terms without a solid framework for crisis resolution and an ability to deal with sovereign default by a member state . The view that member states cannot be allowed to fail logically implies that a political or at least a fiscal union must underpin the euro .
This is the choice that European leaders now confront : a radical step forward toward political or policy integration , or a clear framework to deal with the consequences of a member country &apos;s failure to abide by the fundamental rules of the monetary union .
No amount of money will allow European leaders to fudge this issue .
Are the Dollar \ u0027s Days Numbered ?
A year ago , the dollar bestrode the world like a colossus .
Now it is humbled and the euro looks triumphant .
Is the dollar on the way out as the world &apos;s unchallenged reserve and trade currency ?
Or is &quot; euro triumphalism &quot; premature ?
That question preoccupies not only speculators tracking the dollar &apos;s decline , but ordinary businessmen who wonder what currency to use when invoicing imports or exports .
Indeed , the part that currencies play in world trade through their role in invoicing receives too little attention .
Currently , the US dollar remains dominant .
Most US exports and imports are denominated in dollars , and the dollar is extensively used in trade that does not involve America .
Since 1980 , however , the dollar has lost ground .
Estimates from the European Commission indicate that the dollar &apos;s share in world trade fell from 56 % in 1980 to 52 % in 1995 ( the latest year for which statistics are available ) .
The Deutsche Mark &apos;s share remained relatively unchanged between 1980 and 1995 .
The yen lags behind , but had the highest relative growth , with its share of world trade more than doubling from 2 % in 1980 to almost 5 % in 1995 .
Among the reasons for the dollar &apos;s longtime dominance as the premier international currency are lower transactions costs in foreign exchange markets , the historical role of the dollar in world trade since 1945 , and the sheer size of America &apos;s economy .
But the role of size is more complex than it seems .
The second biggest economy in the world is Japan &apos;s , but the fraction of its trade denominated in yen remains low , even when compared to the smallest European countries .
One factor that explains this is the large share of US firms in markets where Americans sell their goods .
To understand the reasons behind all this , consider what factors are in play when a firm chooses the currency it uses to invoice for goods .
Here an exporter faces two types of risk : price risk and competitiveness risk .
Consider a Japanese firm seeking to make the highest yen profits on goods sold in Switzerland .
If the Japanese firm sets the price in Swiss francs , it is exposed to price risk as the yen price will fluctuate with the yen @-@ Swiss franc exchange rate .
This tends to make Japanese exporters prefer to price in yen .
But firms also care about what their competitors do .
If the Japanese firm sells its goods to a particular Swiss market dominated by Swiss firms ( which invoice in Swiss francs ) , it would prefer to price in Swiss francs too .
If it priced in yen , it would risk losing its market share if the yen appreciated .
If Japanese firms are dominant in a particular Swiss market , they prefer to price in yen : a Japanese firm then would not have to worry about losing market share when the yen appreciated , because its competitors would face the same pressures .
These arguments explain the big role played by the dollar in trade .
The fact that the US is large makes it more likely that US firms are dominant in a particular market , either as an exporter or as import @-@ competitors when foreign goods are sold in America .
This implies that US firms price in dollars , whether they sell at home or abroad , and foreign firms for competitive reasons will also price in dollars when they export to the US .
Because Japan has the second largest economy in the world , the yen should be a more important currency .
Competitiveness is a key reason for why it is not .
First , the US is Japan &apos;s largest trading partner : more than half of Japanese trade with industrialized countries is with the US .
Over 80 % of Japanese exports to the US are priced in dollars , in markets where US firms tend to dominate .
Second , even when selling to countries other than the US , Japanese exporters often face stiff American competition .
Take Japanese exports to South East Asia , which are almost 50 % denominated in dollars due to competition from US exporters .
These factors are unlikely to change soon and lead us to predict that the yen will keep a low profile in world trade .
They also explain why , over time , the euro should gain weight in international trade .
Euro @-@ zone countries can be considered a single country when dealing with the currency denomination of trade .
This &apos; country &apos; has more market power than the individual countries that form the European Monetary Union .
So the euro should play a larger role in international trade in the future than the sum of the currencies it replaced .
Yet these changes will only occur gradually .
So the &quot; euro triumphalism &quot; that has greeted the dollar &apos;s decline is , indeed , premature .
Despite its current distress , the dollar should retain its predominance for some time to come .
Are the Saudis Fanatics ?
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud &apos;s prospects for survival , but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive .
Somehow , it seems , Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy .
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States were Saudis crystallized a long @-@ held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance .
In some respects , this perception is accurate , but it cannot be applied to the broad Saudi public .
On the contrary , it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion .
Between 2001 and 2003 , I was part of a team that undertook an extensive survey of values in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Iran , and Jordan .
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes .
Compared to respondents in the other Middle Eastern countries , Saudis were less religious overall , and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a moderate undercurrent .
To be sure , in all four countries , religiosity is widespread , with more than 90 % of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God , in life after death , and in heaven and hell .
But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims .
Sixty @-@ two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious , compared with 82 % of Iranians , 85 % of Jordanians , and 98 % of Egyptians .
Americans also appear to be far more religious than Saudis , with 81 % describing themselves that way .
Some of this variation may be explained by cross @-@ national differences regarding what it means to be religious .
For example , Americans may define religiosity differently than Middle Easterners , with perhaps a weaker attachment to religious beliefs than is true in Islamic countries .
This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries .
But the gap in self @-@ defined religiosity between Saudis , on the one hand , and Iranians , Jordanians , and Egyptians , on the other , is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society .
Indeed , actions speak louder than words : only 28 % of Saudis said that they participate in weekly religious services , compared to 27 % of Iranians , 44 % of Jordanians , 42 % of Egyptians , and 45 % of Americans .
These findings , while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture , are less startling than they appear .
Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment , or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state , the overall religiosity of the public declines .
It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior , people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions .
Little wonder , then , that Egyptians and Jordanians , who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety , are more religious than Iranians or Saudis , who must cope with local &quot; virtue &quot; police backed by the state .
Even on marriage , many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views .
Respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages , with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent , while 48 % preferred love as the basis of matrimony .
Given entrenched gender segregation and paternal dominance , this finding appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family @-@ driven decision .
Finally , the Saudis turn out to be strong supporters of democracy , once again contradicting a popular image of Saudi conservatism .
Of the Saudis polled , 58 % considered democracy the best form of government , 23 % disagreed , and 18 % did not express an opinion .
Majority support for democracy in a country with no prior secular and nationalist history seems counter @-@ intuitive .
In fact , support for democracy corresponds with a number of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia .
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious , more secular , more tolerant of others , more critical of public @-@ sector performance , and more concerned with Western cultural invasion .
Beyond the survey data , history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs people in alliance with a religious establishment .
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid .
At the same time , an anti @-@ clerical , secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran - a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar Shahs and the religious establishment .
In view of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia , we ought not to rule out the possibility of reform .
Now survey data , too , suggest that Saudis may well begin demanding a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion .
Are US Middle @-@ Class Incomes Really Stagnating ?
CAMBRIDGE - The challenge of raising the incomes of middle @-@ class families has emerged as an important focus of the presidential election campaign in the United States .
Everyone agrees that incomes at the top have surged ahead in recent decades , helped by soaring rewards for those with a high @-@ tech education and rising share prices .
And there is general support for improving programs - such as food stamps and means @-@ tested retiree benefits - that help those who would otherwise be poor .
But the public debate is largely about how to help the more numerous ( and politically more important ) middle class .
Here , much can be done by improving existing government programs : expanding market @-@ relevant training , increasing opportunities for married women to join or rejoin the labor force , reducing the penalties in Social Security rules for continued employment by older workers , and changing tax rules in ways that will increase productivity and wages .
But , while strengthening such programs should be a high priority , we should not lose sight of how well middle @-@ income families have actually done over the past few decades .
Unfortunately , the political debate is distorted by misleading statistics that grossly understate these gains .
For example , it is frequently said that the average household income has risen only slightly , or not at all , for the past few decades .
Some US Census figures seem to support that conclusion .
But more accurate government statistics imply that the real incomes of those at the middle of the income distribution have increased about 50 % since 1980 .
And a more appropriate adjustment for changes in the cost of living implies a substantially greater gain .
The US Census Bureau estimates the money income that households receive from all sources and identifies the income level that divides the top and bottom halves of the distribution .
This is the median household income .
To compare median household incomes over time , the authorities divide these annual dollar values by the consumer price index to create annual real median household incomes .
The resulting numbers imply that the cumulative increase from 1984 through 2013 was less than 10 % , equivalent to less than 0.3 % per year .
Any adult who was alive in the US during these three decades realizes that this number grossly understates the gains of the typical household .
One indication that something is wrong with this figure is that the government also estimates that real hourly compensation of employees in the non @-@ farm business sector rose 39 % from 1985 to 2015 .
The official Census estimate suffers from three important problems .
For starters , it fails to recognize the changing composition of the population ; the household of today is quite different from the household of 30 years ago .
Moreover , the Census Bureau &apos;s estimate of income is too narrow , given that middle @-@ income families have received increasing government transfers while benefiting from lower income @-@ tax rates .
Finally , the price index used by the Census Bureau fails to capture the important contributions of new products and product improvements to Americans &quot; standard of living .
Consider first the changing nature of households .
From 1980 to 2010 , the share of &quot; households &quot; that consisted of just a single man or woman rose from 26 % to 33 % , while the share that contained married couples declined from 60 % to 50 % .
When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) conducted a detailed study of changes in household incomes from 1979 to 2011 , it expanded the definition of income to include near @-@ cash benefits like food stamps and in @-@ kind benefits like health care .
It also subtracted federal taxes , which fell from 19 % of pretax income for middle @-@ income households in 1980 to just 11.5 % in 2010 .
To convert annual incomes to real incomes , the CBO used the price deflator for consumer expenditures , which many believe is better for this purpose than the consumer price index .
The CBO also presented a separate analysis that adjusted for household size .
With the traditional definition of money income , the CBO found that real median household income rose by just 15 % from 1980 to 2010 , similar to the Census Bureau &apos;s estimate .
But when they expanded the definition of income to include benefits and subtracted taxes , they found that the median household &apos;s real income rose by 45 % .
Adjusting for household size boosted this gain to 53 % .
And , again , even this more substantial rise probably represents a substantial underestimate of the increase in the real standard of living .
The authorities arrive at their estimates by converting dollar incomes into a measure of real income by using a price index that reflects the changes in the prices of existing goods and services .
But that price index does not reflect new products or improvements to existing goods and services .
Thus , if everyone &apos;s money incomes rose by 2 % from one year to the next , while the prices of all goods and services also rose by 2 % , the official calculation would show no change in real incomes , even if new products and important quality improvements contributed to our wellbeing .
Indeed , the US government does not count the value created by Internet services like Google and Facebook as income at all , because these services are not purchased .
No one knows how much such product innovations and improvements have added to our wellbeing .
But if the gains have been worth just 1 % a year , over the past 30 years that would cumulate to a gain of 35 % .
And combining that with the CBO estimate of a gain of about 50 % would imply that the real income of the median household is up nearly 2.5 % a year over the past 30 years .
So the US middle class has been doing much better than the statistical pessimists assert .
And with better policies , these households can do even better in the future .
Are We Five Years Wiser ?
As the fifth anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States by al @-@ Qaeda approaches , we should take the opportunity to assess the results of the response by the US and the international community .
The attacks and the response to them have obviously brought about a sea change in international relations , but it would be difficult to argue that further atrocities have become less likely as a result .
Why are we no more secure than we were five years ago ?
Within a week of the attacks , President George W. Bush declared a &quot; war on terrorism . &quot;
The metaphor of war has the singular advantage that it clearly and strongly evokes the intensity of the counterattack that was called for .
Moreover , the metaphor of war constitutes an implicit appeal to intense mobilization , not only by a country that comes under attack , but also by its friends and allies .
Naturally , no one questions America &apos;s right to defend itself .
The legitimacy of a violent counterattack has never been in doubt .
But the war metaphor also carries inevitable connotations that , when applied to terrorism , are misleading and counterproductive .
Whenever war is invoked , it implies a fight against nations , peoples , or states .
It implies that whole territories and the populations living there are to be considered hostile .
War implies armies and command structures that can be recognized , if not clearly known ; in any case , war entails a military confrontation with an identifiable adversary .
On all of these points , the concept of war , to paraphrase US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , is not helpful .
Even if the scale of the September 11 attack was of such a dimension that only the American army seemed able to face the challenge , in technical terms dealing with a threat that is extra @-@ national rather than international is a matter of police techniques , not military tactics .
The negative consequences of this mistaken vision very quickly became apparent .
It is now widely known that the US government , perhaps partly unconsciously , embraced a deeply distorted image of al @-@ Qaeda that portrayed it as a hierarchical organization with a seamless command structure - the prototype of a foe that the American army could attack and destroy .
But al @-@ Qaeda - the word means &quot; the base &quot; or &quot; the camp , &quot; that is , nothing more or less than a point of gathering and training - is more like a blurred sphere of influence , comprising individuals and small local cells that act on their own initiative and cooperate very rarely , and only for large @-@ scale operations .
It has not been proved that the attacks in London , Madrid , or Bali in the years since the September 11 plot , or the attack on America &apos;s warship the USS Cole in 2000 , reflected the existence of a &quot; center &quot; that coordinated the operations or gave orders to carry them out .
It is also wrong to conflate Islamic terrorism with that of the Basque ETA , Sri Lanka &apos;s Tamil Tigers , or the Irish Republican Army .
Whereas these groups have a territorial base and are preoccupied with national aims , Islamic terrorism appears to be the work of a very small number of individuals who seek to avenge the centuries @-@ long &quot; humiliation &quot; of the Muslim world , brought about by colonization , absence of economic development , and political weakness .
The goal of Islamic terrorists is nothing less than the destruction of the &quot; hegemonic &quot; Western world , despite most Muslim nations &quot; desire to live in peace within the international community and to cooperate in crafting effective development strategies .
The only viable strategy for confronting the threat of Islamic terrorism was , and continues to be , a search for agreement among Muslims , and among the leaders of Muslim nations , on the forms of mutual cooperation , including police cooperation , that are needed to isolate , weaken , or destroy the militants in their midst .
This is a long and difficult enterprise , but there remains no alternative .
Instead , the war metaphor continues to define the US response and that of several of America &apos;s allies .
The attraction of this metaphor may be attributable to the excessive trust that Americans place not only in their army , which is understandable , but in force in general , which is much less understandable in the case of an intelligent people .
Whatever the case , casting the fight against terrorism as a war has led American policymakers to multiply violent military operations that have absolutely no chance of winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world .
Quite the contrary .
Afghanistan was the only case where a military response was understandable : its government had , after all , given al @-@ Qaeda a temporary territorial home .
But to implicate Iraq , which had nothing to do with al @-@ Qaeda or the September 11 attacks , was a huge mistake , one that has strengthened Islamic extremists and has probably helped them recruit terrorists .
Moreover , the US response has strengthened Israel &apos;s belief in the effectiveness of military methods , leading to the recent war in Lebanon and the ongoing invasion of Gaza .
Powerless , the international community does nothing .
The rigidity and brutality of America &apos;s behavior - resulting in many times more civilian deaths than occurred on September 11 - have blocked any useful intervention by countries such as Algeria , Morocco , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , or the United Arab Emirates .
Likewise , the appeal of war has ruled out the prospect of serious negotiations between Israel , Syria , and Lebanon .
By attacking one Muslim country after another , the US and its allies have created the impression that Islam itself is the enemy , leading inexorably to the &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; that America says it wants to avoid .
But America &apos;s strategy has failed .
Force cannot accomplish everything .
The international community must say clearly that Islam is not our enemy and that terrorism must be fought in other ways .
Muslim political leaders , for their part , should declare just as openly that terrorism is not their choice .
If both sides can stifle their murderous deviances , the hope of cultural and political reconciliation will be reborn .
Are We Really Secessionists Now ?
LONDON - The World Court &apos;s recent ruling on Kosovo &apos;s unilateral declaration of independence is being widely touted as giving a green light to secessionist movements to gain statehood .
According to Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu , &quot; The decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognize the Republic of Kosovo could have . &quot;
But this reading is largely wishful thinking by those who support secession .
The Court &apos;s non @-@ binding advisory opinion responded to a narrow question posed by the United Nations General Assembly : whether declaring independence is legal under international law . The judges rightly held that there is no international rule preventing a group from stating its intention or wish to form a state .
But they said nothing about the terms and conditions that apply to following through on this intention - i.e. , the act of secession itself .
Indeed , the Court sought to leave no doubt about this : &quot; The question is narrow and specific ... it does not ask whether or not Kosovo has achieved statehood . &quot; The judges contrasted their opinion with that handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada when it was asked to rule on Quebec &apos;s right to secede unilaterally .
In that case , the question went far beyond a declaration of independence ; the court was asked whether and under what conditions Quebec had a right to break away from Canada , under either the Canadian constitution or international law .
The Canadian judges held that international law granted no such unilateral right ( and nor did the country &apos;s own constitution ) .
As the World Court pointed out , its judgment last week did not refute that crucial point : &quot; The Court is not required by the question it has been asked to take a position ... on whether international law generally confers an entitlement on entities within a State to break away from this &#91; State &#93; . &quot;
Moreover , the Court noted the radically different views expressed before it on whether self @-@ determination in international law implies a unilateral right to secede .
By acknowledging the range and intensity of disagreement among states on a right to secede , the Court seems to have hinted that the necessary consent of the world community does not exist to establish firmly the existence of any such right .
Before concluding that there is now a &quot; clear path &quot; to Kosovo &apos;s independence , it is worth pondering the important questions that the Court did not answer ( and was not asked by the General Assembly ) .
The Court was not asked , and thus did not rule on , whether international law requires that the final status of Kosovo protect the group and individual rights of minorities , whether Kosovar Serbs or Roma .
Likewise , the Court was not asked and did not rule on whether Serbia or , indeed , any other state in the world community is required to recognize Kosovo as an independent state .
Nor did the Court &apos;s decision address the borders of an independent Kosovo , or whether and under what circumstances force could legally be used either to impose independence or to resist it .
If the fate of Kosovo - and the entire Balkan region - is to be guided by the global rule of law , these questions need to be answered , not swept under the table .
Under existing procedures , framing questions to the World Court is entirely a prerogative of states , either as contending parties or , as with the Kosovo opinion , operating through the UN .
But the rights of persons and peoples , not just interests of states , are at stake in controversies such as this one .
To fulfill international justice today , we need a new kind of World Court , open to other voices .
Are We Running Out of Oil ( Again ) ?
Oil prices are now running well above $ 50 a barrel , partly owing to short @-@ run supply shocks , such as the Iraq conflict , Nigerian labor disputes , the conflict between Yukos Oil and the Russian government , and Florida &apos;s recent hurricanes .
Oil prices may fall once these shocks dissipate , but speculative effects could keep them relatively high , weakening the world economy and depressing stock markets .
Even a temporary spike in oil prices can have long @-@ term effects because of the social reactions they provoke . High oil prices fuel public discussion about the future of oil prices .
The outcome of any public discussion can never be known with certainty , but chances are that it will amplify stories that imply risks of higher oil prices .
Experts may say that short @-@ run supply factors caused the recent price increases , but the price increases will nonetheless lend credibility to scarier long @-@ term stories .
The scary story that is being amplified now concerns the developing world , notably China and India , where rapid economic growth - and no restrictions on emissions under the Kyoto Protocol - are seen as creating insatiable demands for oil .
The story &apos;s premise is that the world will run out of oil faster than we thought , as these billions of people chase their dreams of big houses and sport utility vehicles .
Is this plausible ?
Certainly , China , India , and some other emerging countries are developing fast .
But experts find it difficult to specify the long @-@ run implications of this for the energy market .
Too many factors remain fuzzy : the rate of growth of these countries &apos; energy demand , discoveries of new oil reserves , developments in oil @-@ saving technology , and the ultimate replacement of oil by other energy sources .
But what matters for oil prices now and in the foreseeable future is the perception of the story , not the ambiguities behind it .
If there is a perception that prices will be higher in the future , then prices will tend to be higher today .
That is how markets work .
If it is generally thought that oil prices will be higher in the future , owners of oil reserves will tend to postpone costly investments in exploration and expansion of production capacity , and they may pump oil at below capacity .
They would rather sell their oil and invest later , when prices are higher , so they restrain increases in supply .
Expectations become self @-@ fulfilling , oil prices rise , a speculative bubble is born .
But if owners of oil reserves think that prices will fall in the long run , they gain an incentive to explore for oil and expand production now in order to sell as much oil as possible before the fall .
The resulting supply surge drives down prices , reinforces expectations of further declines , and produces the inverse of a speculative bubble : a collapse in prices .
All of this may seem obvious , but we tend not to think of oil prices as being determined by expectations of future prices .
For example , in January 1974 , when the first world oil crisis began , oil prices doubled in just days .
The immediate cause was believed to have been Israel &apos;s stunning success in the Yom Kippur War , which led Arab oil producers to retaliate by choking off output .
The second crisis , in 1979 , is usually attributed to supply disruptions from the Persian Gulf following the Islamic revolution in Iran and the subsequent start of the Iran @-@ Iraq war .
Why , then , did real inflation @-@ corrected oil prices remain at or above their 1974 levels until 1986 ?
Speculative pressures are likely to have been at work , influencing the decisions of OPEC and many others .
Although changes in market psychology are difficult to understand , the broad concerns that underlie such episodes of irrational exuberance are almost always clear .
For example , in 1972 , scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , including computer pioneer Jay Forrester , published The Limits to Growth .
The book launched an international debate on whether the world would soon face immense economic problems due to shortages of oil and other natural resources - problems that seemed to be presaged by OPEC &apos;s production cuts eighteen months later .
The second crisis was immediately preceded by the accident at the Three @-@ Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania in March 1979 , which reinvigorated the anti @-@ nuclear movement .
With nuclear power - regarded as the main technological bulwark against depletion of the world &apos;s oil supplies - suddenly suspect , oil prices doubled again by the year &apos;s end .
After 1979 , fears about limits to growth and nuclear power ebbed .
Oil prices gradually fell , and the stock market began its long climb towards its peak in 2000 .
But the current rise in oil prices shows that people are still eager to embrace &quot; running out of oil &quot; stories - this time focused on China and India - even when short @-@ run factors are to blame .
Indeed , the International Energy Agency noted in September that the usual relationship between oil prices and inventory levels has broken down , with prices much higher than the usual relationship would suggest .
The IEA &apos;s report calls this breakdown evidence of a &quot; structural shift in the market . &quot;
But the same pattern followed the 1973 @-@ 4 and 1979 @-@ 80 oil crises , when prices dropped from their highest peaks , but stayed quite high for years , representing a drag on the stock market , the housing market , and the world economy .
Let &apos;s hope that the effects of the present spike will be more short @-@ lived .
But don &apos;t hold your breath .
Are We Still Evolving ?
NEW HAVEN - Many public @-@ policy decisions are based on implicit assumptions about &quot; human nature , &quot; and it is currently popular to speculate about how evolution might have shaped human behavior and psychology .
But this raises some important questions : are humans continuing to evolve - &amp; # 160 ; and , if so , is our basic biological nature changing - or has modern culture stopped evolution ?
For some traits , we do not have to speculate - we can measure and compare on the basis of studies covering thousands of individuals over several generations .
Such studies have not yet been done on most of the traits where speculation is popular , but they have been done on some traits of medical interest .
What have we learned ?
Scientists are taking two approaches .
In one , they sequence the DNA of particular genes in many individuals with or without some determined health condition and look for differences between the two groups .
This genetic approach measures effects that have accumulated over hundreds to thousands of generations , and the message is clear : humans have evolved in these respects fairly recently , some in one direction , some in another , depending on their environment and other conditions encountered .
From this approach , we have learned , for example , that the ability to digest milk as adults evolved within the last 10,000 years - and several times - in cultures that domesticated sheep , goats , or cattle .
Similar studies have taught us that sensitivity to alcohol consumption and resistance to diseases like malaria and leprosy also evolved within the last several thousand years .
Some scientists , myself included , have taken a different approach .
Instead of looking for changes in genes that take many generations to accumulate until they can be detected , we have measured natural selection directly .
This method can reveal selection in action , working over periods of time as short as one generation - so that it can answer the question of whether modern culture has stopped evolution .
The message of this approach is also clear : natural selection continues to operate in modern cultures .
Whether it will operate consistently enough for a long enough time to produce significant genetic change can be answered only by future generations .
Nevertheless , it is interesting to see in what direction natural selection is starting to shape us .
Some of the answers are surprising .
We measured natural selection operating on women in Framingham , Massachusetts , where a long @-@ term medical study on heart disease produced the data that we used .
The women were born between 1892 and 1956 .
We found significant selection and projected that if it continued for ten generations , the women would evolve to be about two centimeters shorter and have their first child about five months earlier .
This is a surprising result , because women in developed countries have become taller thanks to better nutrition , and are having children later in life for many reasons , some of them cultural .
So what is going on here ?
Three things :
First , we know that giving birth for the first time when younger carries a cost in increased infant mortality , but modern medicine and hygiene have strikingly reduced infant mortality , reducing the cost of younger age at first birth .
We therefore expect a shift toward earlier reproduction , because the costs previously associated with doing so have disappeared - exactly what we found in Framingham .
And we expect those younger women to be shorter simply because they have had less time to grow .
In five other cases , scientists found women in developed countries maturing earlier , in two of them at smaller size ( in the other three cases , size was not measured ) .
It is too early to say that this is a general trend , but right now , all signs point that way .
Second , we measured the effects of natural selection by noting that women who were shorter and first gave birth when younger had more children .
But genes are only one of many factors that influence height and age at first birth .
Personal decisions , nutrition , income level , education , and religious affiliation all enter the mix .
When we estimated how much of the variation among individuals could be attributed to biology , the answer was less than 5 % .
That left 95 % of the variation to be explained by the effects of culture and individual decisions .
But , while the effects of biology on the traits that we measured are relatively small for humans living in complex modern cultures , even small effects , when repeated consistently , will accumulate .
Third , traits like these are always the result of interactions between genes and environment .
A woman could have genes that would tend to make her taller than average but end up shorter than average if she had been poorly nourished as a child . &amp; # 160 ;
If evolution took its steady course and changed the genetic basis of height and age at first birth , we might not see women ten generations later who were shorter and matured earlier , for the effects of nutrition and culture could more than compensate for the genetic change .
As a colleague of mine likes to put it , one good school @-@ lunch program could be enough to obscure the biological effects .
Even when we focus on a simple physical trait like height , natural selection in humans turns out to be a multifaceted and nuanced process .
Similar studies on human behavior and psychology , where causation is more complex , remain beyond our grasp .
In such cases , silence may be wiser than speculation .
Are We Working Ourselves to Death ?
Work can give structure and meaning to life .
But working conditions can also trigger or accelerate the symptoms of ill health - physical and mental - that feed back into our productivity and earning capacity , as well as into our social and family relationships .
In fact , an alarmingly large number of people appear to be at risk .
Of the EU &apos;s 160 million @-@ strong labour force , 56 % report working at very high speeds , and 60 % to tight deadlines .
More than a third have no influence on task order , and 40 % perform monotonous tasks .
This probably contributes to a host of health @-@ related problems : 15 % of the workforce complain of headaches , 33 % of backache , 23 % of fatigue , and 23 % of neck and shoulder pains , plus a host of other illnesses , including life @-@ threatening ones .
Sustained work @-@ related stress is also an important determinant of depressive disorders - the fourth @-@ largest cause of disease world @-@ wide .
They are expected to rank second by 2020 , behind only heart disease .
In the EU , the cost of these and related mental health problems is estimated to average 3 @-@ 4 % of GNP , amounting to approximately 265 billion euros annually .
Moreover , sustained work @-@ related stress is likely to contribute to &apos; metabolic syndrome , &apos; a cluster of pathogenic mechanisms characterised by an accumulation of abdominal fat , a decrease in sensitivity to insulin , increased levels of cholesterol , and heightened blood pressure , all related to the onset of heart disease and diabetes .
Of course , working conditions may be experienced as threatening even when objectively they are not , or trivial symptoms may be interpreted as manifestations of serious illness .
But stress is worrisome precisely because even misinterpretations can add to , or result in , a wide variety of health problems , including heart disease , stroke , cancer , musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal diseases , anxiety and depression , accidents , and suicides .
Briefly stress consists of a pattern of built @-@ in processes preparing the human organism for physical activity in response to demands and influences that tax its capacity to adapt .
Activation of our &quot; fight or flight &quot; mechanism is an appropriate adaptive response when facing a wolf pack , but not so when struggling to adjust to rotating shifts , monotonous and fragmented tasks , or over @-@ demanding customers .
If sustained , stress is often maladaptive and eventually disease provoking .
Stress @-@ related paths to pathologies take a wide variety of forms .
They can be emotional ( anxiety , depression , hypochondria , and alienation ) , cognitive ( loss of concentration or recall , inability to learn new things , be creative , make decisions ) , behavioural ( abuse of drugs , alcohol , and tobacco , refusal to seek or accept treatment ) , or physiological ( neuroendocrine and immunological dysfunction ) .
To identify , prevent , and counteract the causes and consequences of work @-@ related stress , we need to monitor job content , working conditions , terms of employment , social relations at work , health , well @-@ being and productivity .
The first step is to identify the incidence , prevalence , severity , and trends of work @-@ related stress and its causes and health consequences .
Are they likely to contribute to stress @-@ related ill health ?
Can they be changed ?
Are such changes acceptable to workers and employers ?
Wherever the answers are affirmative , an integrated package of organisational changes should be considered .
Such changes are likely to include the following areas :
Work schedule . Design labor time to avoid conflict with demands and responsibilities unrelated to the job ;
Participation / control . Allow workers to take part in decisions or actions affecting their jobs ;
Workload . Ensure that workers have enough time to complete assigned tasks , and allow for recovery from especially demanding physical or mental tasks ;
Content . Design tasks to provide meaning , stimulation , a sense of completeness , and an opportunity to use skills ;
Roles . Define work roles and responsibilities clearly ;
Social environment . Ensure a working atmosphere free of all forms of invidious discrimination and harassment ;
Future . Avoid ambiguity in matters of job security and career development ; promote life @-@ long learning and employability .
Although it is likely , the short- and long @-@ term outcomes of such changes may not always suffice in the fight against work @-@ related stress .
They need therefore to be evaluated in terms of exposures and reactions to stress , the incidence and prevalence of ill health , and the quality and quantity of goods or services .
Many companies world @-@ wide recognize that success requires satisfying the three elements of sustainable development : financial , environmental , and social .
Failure to do so leads , over time , to terminal organizational weakness , owing to lost credibility amongst employees , shareholders , customers , and communities .
This has numerous implications for relations with employees .
Ensuring long @-@ term economic growth and social cohesion requires a commitment to health and safety , a better balance between work , family and leisure , lifelong learning , greater workforce diversity , gender @-@ blind pay and career prospects , and profit @-@ sharing and equity @-@ ownership schemes .
These practices can have a positive impact on profits through increased productivity , lower staff turnover , greater amenability to change , more innovation , and better , more reliable output .
Indeed , companies often have an interest in going beyond minimum legal requirements : peer respect and a good reputation as an employer are marketable assets .
The challenge for science is to find out what to do , for whom , and how .
The challenge to workers , employers , governments , and communities is to translate what we now know into coordinated and sustainable programs .
Argentina : Open Up or Shut Down
&quot; I have an important political mission , &quot; Eduardo Amadeo said on being appointed Argentina &apos;s ambassador to Washington . &quot; I must explain our transition . &quot;
But diplomatic explanations are not what Argentina needs .
It does not need to waste scarce money on diplomacy of dubious value--not when the country lacks an agency dedicated to helping Argentine businessmen sell their goods abroad .
Indeed , the sum Argentina spends on its diplomats is what tiny Ireland spends on its Export Promotion Agency , an institution Argentina never bothered to create .
Instead of talking to fellow diplomats , Argentina &apos;s ambassador to the US should talk to US supermarkets , convincing their managers to buy Argentine goods and arranging for them to meet with small businessmen from his country .
He should not be duplicating what Argentina &apos;s President and Foreign Minister are capable of doing .
Export diplomacy is important , but export promotion , visiting stores and talking to buyers , is even more vital .
European grocery shops are full of products from Israel , but how often do you see Argentine beef or other goods ?
Argentina &apos;s economy opened up significantly in recent years , notwithstanding a strong exchange rate , which made exporting difficult .
Total exports doubled in 1991 @-@ 2001 , from US $ 12 billion to $ 25 billion , with industrial exports growing from $ 3 billion to $ 8 billion .
But the numbers remain very small .
In fact , Argentina is amazingly closed for an economy its size .
Exports do not exceed 10 % of GDP , and manufactured goods account for only about a third of total exports .
Brazil , a country eight times the size , exports 12 % of its economy &apos;s output , and 57 % of Brazilian exports are manufactured goods .
Chile exports almost 30 % of its output .
Some small European countries come close to 50 % .
Little wonder , then , that Argentina &apos;s current crisis is so harsh : the portion of its economy that can generate the export revenues necessary to repay foreign debt is too small .
When a country reaches the point that it needs all its exports to service its national debt , and the size of the export sector is fixed , nothing is left to pay for imports .
So imports dry up and the economy stops .
The more open an economy is , the more easily it can avoid this trap .
Of course , all countries eventually overcome crises .
The question is how .
Argentina now faces a choice that is both economic and political .
The path of development that it chooses as it emerges from its crisis will determine the country &apos;s future for many years to come .
So it is surprising that this choice is not at the center of the political debate in the campaign for the presidency now underway .
There are two ways out of the current morass .
One is the old model : a recovery in real wages and a resumption of consumption .
Viewed from the despairing perspective of today &apos;s crisis , this model seems like a dream .
But if it is implemented , in 3 @-@ 5 years Argentina will look exactly like the country we have always known : a largely closed economy that remains dangerously vulnerable to external shocks .
The alternative is to capitalize on the unique opportunity that this year &apos;s devaluation of the peso offers by making the competitiveness gains last long enough to shift resources into the export sector .
